You O

for O
some O
place AE

start O
a O
grubby O
teacup O
to O
pour O
down O
the O

perhaps O
but O
give O
up O

An O
archway O
to O
the O

affords O
you O
an O
escape O
from O
the O

There's O
also O
a O

Here O
the O

a O

You O

On O

a O

each O
of O
which O
contains O
a O

In O

The O
Castle AE

the O

Castle AE

It O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
way O
in O
or O
out AE
of O
this O
fortress O
. O
You O
find O
it O
slightly O
odd O
that O
there O
are O
no O
guards O
currently O
patrolling O
the O
area O
. O
To O
the O
North O
is O
the O
Castle AE

A O

a O

inside AE
out AE

the O

their O

Fortunately O
a O
very O
large O
bird AE
is O
carrying O
you O

otherwise O
you O

You O
are O
above O
a O

the O

This O
is O
a O
break O
room O
, O
you O
guess O
? O
It O
lacks O
a O
kitchenette O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
with O
no O

, O
no O

and O
no O

. O
The O
large O
refrigerator AE
in O
the O
corner O
looks O
lonely O
, O
its O
surface O
bare O
of O
adornment O
. O
With O
a O
complete O
lack O
of O
tables O
or O
chairs O
, O
it O
seems O
less O
and O
less O
credible O
that O
any O
people O
work O
here O
. O


This O
is O
a O
circular O

from O

a O

off O

An O

I'm O
in O
a O

There O
is O
a O
teeny O
tiny O
cottage AE
here O
complete O
with O
a O
thatched O
roof AE
and O
leaded O
windows AE
. O
It's O
just O
like O
something O
out O
of O
a O
fairy O
tale O
, O
funnily O
enough O
, O
except O
for O
the O
large O
hand O

Just O
to O

A O

Although O
visited O
less O
often O
, O
the O
grounds O
had O
to O
be O
completed O
with O
two O
ornamental O
gateposts AE
; O
something O
makes O
you O
think O
of O
the O
grey O
stone O
eagles AE
perched O
atop O
them O
more O
as O
vultures O
. O
The O
house O
looks O
imposing O
in O
the O
northern O

even O
from O
this O
distance O
, O
and O
a O
path O
leads O
northeast O
through O
the O

South O

You O

The O

Looking O

The O

strip O
of O
flat O
roofed O

around O
the O

Westward O
is O
a O

the O

The O

A O

you O
out O

From O
his O
state O

health O

the O

you O

The O

I O
sleep O
here O

the O

The O
queen O
sized O
double O
bed AE
takes O
a O
dominant O
postion O
, O
mostly O
because O
it's O
the O
only O
comfortable O
thing O
to O
sit O
on O
. O
A O
few O
tatty O
posters AE
line O
the O

to O
the O
northeast O
is O
a O

You O
weren't O
quite O
sure O
what O
you O
were O
expecting O

Crowds AE

sure O

but O
not O
ten AE
thousand AE
people AE
crammed O
into O
a O
tenth AE
as O
many AE
square O
feet O
until O
they O
ferment O
. O
They're O
sort O
of O
herded O
along O
by O
barriers AE

signs AE
, O
but O
once O
you O
reach O
critical O
mass AE
of O
a O
couple O
thousand AE
, O
it O
just O
looks O
like O
an O
enormous O
mass AE
. O
Fortunately O
, O
you O
made O
it O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
line O

Unfortunately O

so O
did O
Brody AE

A O
metallic AE

out AE

The O

Here O
the O

Unfortunately O

a O

swooped O
all O
this O

You're O

In O
the O

the O

Under O

The O

the O

The O
emptiness O
of O
a O
natural O
cathedral AE
of AE
living AE
rock O
rises O
high O
into O
darkness O
above O
you O
, O
far O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
your O
candlelight AE
. O
The O
sound O
of O
your O

echoes O
strangely O

There O
are O
many O
stalactites AE

stalagmites AE
, O
some O
of O
which O
have O
joined O

form O
delicate O
pillars AE

others O
just O
hang O
like O
creamy O
icicles O
in O
the O

Frozen O
rivers O

white O
rock O

Occasionally O
you O

fireflies AE

darting O
between O
the O
columns O

You O

aware O

the O
immense O
mass O

the O
ancient O

some O

Each O

the O

You O

Technically O
, O
if O

to O
demarcate O
it O

Rather O

your O

such O

more O

But O
that O

One O

A O

half O

You O

A O
heavy AE
wooden AE

A O

You're O
standing O
on O
a O
stone O
walkway O
in O
Aunt O
Hildegarde's O
much O
envied O
garden AE
where O
she O
would O
spend O
hours O
tending O
to O
her O
flowers O
, O
bushes O
and O
trees O
. O
The O
garden AE
was O
off O
limits O
to O
you O
as O
a O
child O
because O
of O
an O
incident O
one O
summer O
when O
you O
and O
Cousin O
Herman O
were O
playing O
in O
the O
garden AE
. O
You O
suggested O
pretending O
to O
be O
wild O
African O
animals O
and O
climbed O
a O
tree O
and O
began O
to O
screech O
like O
a O
baboon O
while O
Cousin O
Herman O
ran O
off O
toward O
the O
roses O
shouting O
something O
about O
being O
a O
rhinoceros O
. O


You're O
bobbing O
up O
and O
down O
like O
a O
buoy O
in O
the O
ocean O
, O
subject O
to O
the O
whim O
of O
the O
strong O
river AE
current O
. O
The O
water AE
is O
surprisingly O
cold O
, O
but O
fortunately O
you O
have O
your O
air AE
bladder AE
to O
keep O
you O
afloat O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
center O
of O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
roman O
camp O
, O
though O
long O
since O
converted O
to O
the O
uses O
of O
their O
successors O
. O
It O
is O
apparently O
abandoned O
though O
the O
vegetation O
is O
only O
just O
starting O
to O
encroach O
upon O
the O
trampled O
ground O
. O
In O
all O
directions O
you O
can O
see O
various O
structures O
and O
beyond O
them O
a O
crude AE
palisade AE
. O
A O
wooden AE
tower AE
stands O
to O
one O
side O
. O
The O
swirling AE
portal AE
leads O
back O
to O
the O
vortex O
. O


A O
man AE
glares O
at O
you O
from O
a O
pedestal AE
against O
the O
north O
wall AE
. O
His O
body O
is O
wood O
, O
his O
face O
is O
formed O
from O
paint O
. O
You O
feel O
guilty O
. O
A O
flaming AE
bowl AE
sits O
in O
front O
of O
the O
pedestal AE
. O
A O
doorframe O
leads O
east O
. O


The O
bar O
is O
well O
known O
for O
being O
frequented O
by O
young O
celebrities O
, O
not O
least O
the O
young O
members O
of O
the O
royal O
family O
. O
The O
paparazzi O
are O
waiting O
outside O
. O
A O
chauffeur AE
is O
waiting O
in O
a O
car O
. O


It O
has O
the O
mediocre O
nicety O
of O
a O
place O
that O
doesn't O
want O
to O
look O
cheap O
. O
Two AE
Two AE
sleeping AE
bags AE
are O
rolled O
up O
behind O
a O
plywood AE
table AE
, O
with O
a O
dark O
brown O
and O
mostly O
empty O
Cabinet AE
on O
the O
wall O
. O
This O
place O
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
, O
smells O
like O
air O
freshener O
with O
a O
tang O
of O
fish O
and O
the O
floor O
is O
moving O
. O
So O
, O
being O
here O
is O
like O
throwing O
up O
on O
a O
disco O
toilet O
. O
A O
small O
stair O
leads O
up O
, O
to O
the O
stern O

You O
stand O
on O
the O
eastern O
shore AE
of O
a O
frozen AE
river AE
an O
irregular AE
sheet AE
of AE
pale AE
, O
cracked O
ice AE
. O
It O
must O
not O
be O
solid O
to O
the O
bottom O
, O
for O
the O
current O
hisses O
and O
bubbles O
beneath O
the O
ice AE
, O
emerging O
beyond O
it O
. O


This O
is O
the O
living O
room O
. O
It O
looks O
exactly O
the O
way O
you've O
always O
remembered O
it O
, O
except O
. O
. O
. O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
lacking O
most O
of O
the O
furniture O
you O
remember O
. O
There's O
a O
couch AE
, O
a O
coffee AE
table AE
, O
one O
photograph AE
on O
the O
wall O
and O
that's O
it O
. O
Surely O
it O
didn't O
always O
look O
like O
this O
. O
Wasn't O
there O
a O
TV O
and O
a O
fireplace O
and O
. O
. O
well O
. O
. O
. O
it O
was O
different O
wasn't O
it O
? O
North O
of O
the O
living O
room O
is O
the O
kitchen O
and O
to O
the O

is O
the O
bathroom O

To O
the O
south O
is O
in O
open O
doorway AE
that O
shimmers O
and O
distorts O
the O
view O
of O
the O

behind O
it O
. O


Kitchen O
A O
firepit AE
in O
the O
floor O
smokes O
badly O
, O
fogging O
up O
the O
depths O
of O
this O
large O
kitchen O
, O
somehow O
not O
escaping O
through O
either O
the O
south O
or O
west O
doors O
. O


Snug O
and O
dry O
, O
there's O
really O
no O
place O
like O
home O
. O
This O
vaulting O
cavern O
offers O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
unfurled O
wings AE
and O
the O
sandy O
floor O
, O
good O
purchase O
for O
extended O
talons O
. O
Bright O
daylight O
streams O
in O
through O
a O
large O
circular O
hole O
to O
the O
west O

East O

a O
smaller O

darker O
opening O

All O
the O
closed O
places O
provide O
shelter O
for O
the O
people O
from O
the O
rain O
. O
In O
days O
like O
this O
, O
coffee O
houses O
are O
more O
crowded O
than O
ordinary O
days O
. O
People O
talk O
to O
each AE
other O
and O
there O
is O
a O
humming O
sound O
in O
the O
place O
. O
The O
music O
is O
some O
old O
school O
rock'n O
roll O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
overpoweringly O
fragrant O
rose O
bush AE
section O
of O
the O
garden AE
. O
As O
you O
admire O
the O
roses O
by O
the O
full O
moon's O
light AE
, O
you O
notice O
one O
somewhat O
sickly O
rose O
bush AE
. O
The O
stone O
walkway O
leads O
northwest O
and O
southwest O
. O


This O
part O
of O
the O
town O

radically O
different O
from O
