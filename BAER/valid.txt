The O

is O
monumentally O

You O
look O
for O
some O
place B-ART
to O
start O
a O
grubby O
teacup O
to O
pour O
down O
the O

perhaps O

give O
up O

An O
archway O
to O

you O
an O

There's O

Here O
the O

a O
stout B-ART
lilac I-ART

A O

At O
the O

a O

at O

almost O
a O

almost O
perhaps O
a O

it O

The O
Castle B-ART
Path O
leads O
directly O
to O
the O
Gate B-ART
of O
Trein O
Hill O
Castle B-ART
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
way O
in O
or O
out B-ART
of O
this O
fortress O
. O
You O
find O
it O
slightly O
odd O
that O
there O
are O
no O
guards O
currently O
patrolling O
the O
area O
. O
To O
the O
North O
is O
the O
Castle B-ART
Gate I-ART
; O
and O
the O
Fields O
are O
to O
the O
south O
. O


A O
dark O
tunnel B-ART
goes O
further O
than O

A O
cloaked O

A O
sandy B-ART
sea B-ART

Small O

To O
the O
North O
lies O
a O
mysteriously B-ART
inside B-ART
out I-ART
house B-ART
; O
the O
rooms B-ART
and O
their O
contents B-ART
pointing I-ART
in O
all O

Fortunately O
a O
very O
large O
bird B-ART
is O
carrying O
you O
, O
otherwise O
you O
would O
fall O
. O
You O
are O
above O
a O
trackless O
wilderness B-ART
to O
the O
east O
of O
a O
range O
of O
jagged O
mountains B-ART

This O
is O
a O
break O
room O
, O
you O
guess O
? O
It O
lacks O
a O
kitchenette O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
with O
no O
counters O
, O
no O
sinks O
and O
no O
cupboards O
. O
The O
large O
refrigerator B-ART
in O
the O
corner O
looks O
lonely O
, O
its O
surface O
bare O
of O
adornment O
. O
With O
a O
complete O
lack O
of O
tables O
or O
chairs O
, O
it O
seems O
less O
and O
less O
credible O
that O
any O
people O
work O
here O
. O


This O
is O
a O
circular O
room O
from O
which O
a O
corridor O
leads O
off O
to O
the O
south O
. O
An O
automatic B-ART
barrier I-ART
blocks O
the O
way O
north O
. O


I'm O
in O
a O
clearing O
. O
There O
is O
a O
teeny O
tiny O
cottage B-ART
here O
complete O
with O
a O
thatched O
roof B-ART
and O
leaded O
windows B-ART
. O
It's O
just O
like O
something O
out O
of O
a O
fairy O
tale O
, O
funnily O
enough O
, O
except O
for O
the O
large O
hand O
painted O
sign B-ART
designed O
to O
deter O
trespassers O
. O
Just O
to O
the O
north O
is O
the O
front O
porch B-ART
. O
A O
little O
path B-ART
lined O
by O
rows O
of O
white O
painted O
stones B-ART
leads O
around O
the O
side O
of O
the O
house B-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O


Although O
visited O
less O
often O
, O
the O
grounds O
had O
to O
be O
completed O
with O
two O
ornamental O
gateposts B-ART
; O
something O
makes O
you O
think O
of O
the O
grey O
stone O
eagles B-ART
perched O
atop O
them O
more O
as O
vultures O
. O
The O
house O
looks O
imposing O
in O
the O
northern O
landscape B-ART
even O
from O
this O
distance O
, O
and O
a O
path O
leads O
northeast O
through O
the O
shrubbery O
. O
South O
would O
take O
you O
beyond O
your O
prescribed O
area O
. O


Above B-ART
you O
, O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
wheel B-ART
, O
is O
a O
red B-ART
globe I-ART
. O
The O

is O
far O

You O
are O
on O
the O
northeast O
side O
of O
the O
Lonely O
Mountain B-ART
, O
walking O
a O
narrow O
path B-ART
through O
rolling O
hills B-ART

This O
room O
is O
empty O
, O
except O
for O
an O
iron B-ART
door I-ART
in O
the O
north O
wall O
. O
Five O
small O
lights B-ART
are O
mounted O
in O
the O
door B-ART
. O
You O
can O
exit O
to O
the O
south O
. O


You O
stand O
in O
the O
parking O
lot O
of O
a O
dilapidated O
and O
abandoned O
motel B-ART
. O
The O
asphalt B-ART
is O
cracked O
into O
little B-ART
pieces I-ART
, O
like O
dried O
out B-ART
mud I-ART
after O
a O
drought O
. O
Looking O
north O
you O
can O
see O
the O
motel B-ART
check O
in O
office B-ART
. O
The O
horseshoe O
shaped O
strip O
of O
flat O
roofed O
suites B-ART
wraps O
around O
the O
perimeter O
of O
the O
property O
. O
Westward O
is O
a O
heavily O
overgrown O
patch O
of O
land B-ART
, O
apparently O
once O
a O
garden B-ART
. O
To O
the O
southeast O
a O
path B-ART
leads O
around O
to O
behind O
the O

The O

a O
wonderful O

Look B-ART

It O
rolls O
easily O
off O
the O

It O
is O
a O
deceptively O
quiet O
evening O
on O
the O
ship B-ART
, O
the O
pirates B-ART
singing O
low O
shanties O
as O
they O
repair O
cannon O
, O
twist O

The O
mainmast B-ART
casts O
an O
inky O
shadow O
over O
the O
canvas O
screening O
the O
hatch B-ART
. O
A O
tangled O
mass O
of O
rigging B-ART
hangs O
down O
from O
the O
mast B-ART
, O
like O
many B-ART
rope O
ladders O
woven O
together O
. O


You're O
standing O
in O
a O
cramped O
metal B-ART
maintenance O
shaft O
which O
leads O
below O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
spaceship O
. O
There's O
not O
much O
space O
here O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
bend O
down O
a O
little O
to O
remain O
upright O
. O
The O
shaft O
stretches O
out O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O


The O
trail B-ART
makes O
a O
hairpin O
turn O
here O
, O
swinging O
out O
to O
the O
northwest O
and O
northeast O
, O
where O
it O
enters O
a O
small O
village O

Dun O
tumbles O
down O
loosely O
from O
a O
steep O
hill B-ART
to O
the O

sliced O

the O
wall B-ART
to O
the O

This O
room O
is O
cobwebby O
and O
musty O
, O
but O
tracks O
in O
the O
dust O
show O
that O
it O
has O
seen O
visitors O
recently O
. O
At O
the O
south O

of O
the O

is O
a O

An O

A O

Imbedded O
in O
the O

is O
a O
rusty O
box B-ART

It O
appears O
to O
be O
somewhat O

Although O
perfectly O

more O

At O

for O
a O

the O

looks O
a O

Further O

up O
the O

You're O

Even O
your O

A O

It O

you O
do O

You O
pause O
a O
moment O
to O
take O
it O
all O

This O

been O
your O
home O

Your O

your O
normal O

very O
beautiful O
neighborhood B-ART

So O
beautiful O
in O
fact O
that O
it O
even O
got O
your O
lazy O
bum O
to O
start O
planting O
flowers B-ART
at O
your O
front O
home O
, O
just O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
your O

It O
was O
peak O
peace O

joy O
, O
this O

Except O
for O
that O

First O
base O

It's O
where O
everything B-ART
starts O
, O
isn't O
it O
? O
Well O
, O
in O
this O
case O
, O
it O
really O
started O
on O
the O
pitcher's O
mound O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O

there O
, O
so O
maybe O
you'll O
have O
better O

here O

the O

out O

The O
queen O

double O

takes O
a O
dominant O
postion O

mostly O
because O
it's O
the O
only O

to O

A O

They're O

once O
you O

it O
just O
looks O

an O

Fortunately O

you O

an O

To O
the O

a O
wide O

metallic O

The O
trees B-ART
whisper O
softly O
in O
the O
cool O
autumn O

You O
stand B-ART
on O
the O
northern O
fringe O
of O
the O
forest B-ART

beside O
the O
muddy B-ART
track B-ART

shows O
the O

the O

You O

the O
Night O

The O

The O
teak O

is O
very O
well O
kept O

The O
ocean B-ART
lies O
off O

You O
stand O
at O
the O

of O
a O
vast O
round O
space O

An O
immense B-ART
dome I-ART
arches O
above B-ART
you O

The O
butcher O

are O
dark O
with O
grime O

The O

have O
no O

There O

more O

This O

There's O

This O

an O
old B-ART
secret I-ART

up O

The O

feebly O

in O
the O

A O
small B-ART
outcropping O
of O
stone O
, O
just O
large B-ART
enough O
for O
you O
to O
stand O
on O
, O
sticks O
out O
from O
the O
end O
of O
the O
breakwater O
. O
The O
hungry O
sea B-ART
laps O
at O
your O
feet O

surging O
over O
the O
rocks O

then O
trickling O
down O

To O
the O

an O
uneven O

You're O
standing O
under O
an O

archway B-ART
that O

the O

A O
busy O
street O
lies O
to O
the O

the O
campus O
quad O
opens O
up O

the O

The O
entrance B-ART
of O
the O
house B-ART
looks O
at O
first O
glance O
as O
normal O
as O
could O
be O
, O
but O
the O
steel O
plates O
reinforcing O
the O
front O
door B-ART
belie O
that O
perception O
. O
There's O
a O
doorbell B-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART

You O
are O
on O
Whizbang B-ART
Road I-ART
, O
which O
happens O
to O
run O
east O
and O
west O
through O
this O
area O
. O
It O
is O
a O
rather O
plain O
road B-ART
covered O
in O
asphalt O
and O
in O
an O
apparent O
contradiction O
to O
it's O
name O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
spectacular O
to O
look O
at O
here O
, O
in O
fact O
the O
road B-ART
is O
sort O
of O
boring O
. O
You O
are O
currently O
at O
mile O
marker O

Well O
, O
it's O
private O
, O
at O
least O
. O
They O
assured O
you O
of O
this O
. O
It's O
a O
crumbly O
gray O
hole O
dug O
into O
a O
gray O
field B-ART
, O
yes O
, O
and O
the O
air's O
choked O
with O
dust B-ART
. O
You O
can't O
move O
without O
kicking O
up O
a O
new O
cloud B-ART
and O
blinding O
yourself B-ART
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
, O
not O
that O
there'd O
be O
much O
to O
miss O
. O
But O
at O
least O
people O
can't O
see O
you O
here O
. O
Even O
if O
someone O
down O
below O
were O
to O
look O
at O
the O
sky B-ART
when O
you O
were O
out B-ART
of O
your O
trench O
, O
they'd O
merely O
see O
a O
shiny O
speck O
. O
Windows O
get O
them O
all O
the O
time O
. O


You O
are O
sleeping O
in O
bed O
. O
Everything O
is O
all O
woozy O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
your O

is O
north O

Your O
alarm B-ART
clock I-ART
sits O
next O
to O
you O

Judging O
by O
the O
bullet O
holes O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
the O
latest O
in O
redneck O
technology O
lies O
inside O
your O
pillow B-ART
. O


On O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
is O
a O
whiteboard B-ART
. O
The O
door B-ART
out O
of O
the O

is O
open O

You O
could O
walk O
right O
out O

here O
, O
if O
you O
wanted O

You O
are O
standing O
at O
the O

to O
the O
Greater O

Great O
Underground O
Subway O

. O
The O
train O
platform O
lies O
past O
the O
gate B-ART
to O
the O
south O
, O
or O
stairs O
lead O
up O
into O
the O
city O
. O


The O
emptiness O
of O
a O
natural O
cathedral B-ART
of I-ART
living I-ART
rock O
rises O
high O
into O
darkness O
above O
you O
, O
far O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
your O
candlelight B-ART
. O
The O
sound O
of O
your O
footsteps O
echoes O
strangely O
. O
There O
are O
many O
stalactites B-ART
and I-ART
stalagmites I-ART
, O
some O
of O
which O
have O
joined O
to O
form O
delicate O
pillars B-ART
, O
others O
just O
hang O
like O
creamy O
icicles O
in O
the O
still O
, O
crisp O
air B-ART
. O
Frozen O
rivers O
of O
snow O
white O
rock O
spill O
down O
from O
the O
ceiling B-ART
beside O
a O
dark O
fissure B-ART
that O
spits O
the O
southern O
wall B-ART
. O
Occasionally O
you O
see O
fireflies B-ART
dancing O
and O
darting O
between O
the O
columns O
of O
pale O
stone O
. O
You O
are O
aware O
of O
the O
immense O
mass O
of O
the O
ancient O
mountains O
above O
. O


You O
can O
see O
some O
tubs B-ART
of O
animal O
feed B-ART
and O
a O
lead B-ART
rein I-ART
here O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
tiny O
, O
smelly O
space O
where O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
breathe O
. O
By O
your O
feet O
lie O
the O
diesel O
engines B-ART
of O
the O
Night O
Wind B-ART
. O


This O
clearing O
is O
apparently O
a O
brief O
widening B-ART
of O
some O
ancient B-ART
river O
. O
There O
are O
various O
small B-ART
passages I-ART
winding O
around O
two O
large B-ART
boulders I-ART
. O
These O
are O
to O
the O
north O
, O
south O
, O
and O
west O
. O


A O
row O
of O
suites B-ART
runs O
north O
south O
between O
the O
tavern O
and O
the O
south O
wing O
. O
It's O
dilapidated O
and O
heavily O
boarded O
up O
, O
much O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
surroundings O
. O


Each O
shop O
on O
this O
street O
seems O
to O
be O
smaller O
than O
the O
last O
, O
and O
the O
travel B-ART
agency O
is O
no O
exception O
, O
being O
nothing O
but O
a O
desk B-ART
and O
a O
rack B-ART
of I-ART
travel I-ART
brochures I-ART
. O


You O
amuse O
yourself O
to O
think O
of O
this O
as O
your O
living O
room B-ART
. O
Technically O
, O
if O
you O
have O
to O
demarcate O
it O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
apartment O
, O
it O
is O
that O
which O
is O
not O
the O
bathroom B-ART
or O
kitchen B-ART
. O


You O
stand O
atop O
the O
highest O
cliff O
on O
the O
island O
. O
There O
is O
a O
small O
shack B-ART
here O
, O
housing O
your O
makeshift O
radio O
. O


The O
barren O
walls B-ART
, O
the O
scattered O
books B-ART
, O
and O
the O
splendid O
view O
of O
sunlight O
coming O
through O
the O
window B-ART
fills O
you O
with O
a O
wonderful O
feeling O
of O
being O
back B-ART
where O
you O
belong O
. O


Uncle O
Oscar's O
kitchen B-ART
is O
fairly O
simple O
some O
cupboards B-ART
, O
a O
fridge B-ART
, O
an O
oven B-ART
, O
a O
counter B-ART
with O
a O
sink B-ART
built O
in O
. O
It O
didn't O
actually O
get O
used O
all O
that O
much O
he O
always O
griped O
about O
Daisy's O
cooking O
. O
You O
never O
saw O
anything O
wrong O
with O
it O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
you've O
always O
been O
a O
fan O
of O
peanut O
butter O
sandwiches O
. O
The O
back B-ART
door O
to O
the O
kitchen B-ART
opens O
onto O
the O
forest O
to O
the O
west O

to O
the O

a O
doorway B-ART
leads O

the O

Flat O
, O
featureless O
gray O
is O
in O
every O
direction O

look O
. O
Stranger O
still O
is O
the O
upright O
rectangular O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
fabric O
of O
space O
that O
stands O
in O
the O
center O
of O
this O
area O

Otherwise O
, O
you O
could O
wander O
this O
gray O
dimension O
in O
any O
direction O
, O
it O
seems O
. O


You've O
come O
to O
an O
entrance B-ART

Above O
the O

, O
up O
by O
the O

, O
is O
a O
small B-ART
wooden I-ART

on O
the O

with O
a O
small B-ART

with O
a O

of I-ART
machine I-ART
parts I-ART
, I-ART

scrap I-ART
metal I-ART

This O

is O
old O
much O
older O
than O
the O
Hedonan O
prison O
compound O
that O
has O
been O
built O
on O
top O
of O
it O
. O
Some O
of O
the O

looks O
like O
it O
has O
been O
here O
since O
the O
Nuclear O

. O


You O

or O
down O
to O
a O

The O

is O
an O
area O
located O
underneath O
one O
of O
the O
upstairs O
rooms O
. O
Instead O
of O
a O

separating O
it O
from O
the O

there O
is O
a O

The O
door O

isn't O
a O

the O

Over O
the O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O

But O
that O

because O
you O
already O

the O

One O

a O

A O

The O

A O
small B-ART

A O

A O

You're O
standing O
on O
a O
stone O
walkway O
in O
Aunt O
Hildegarde's O
much O
envied O
garden B-ART
where O
she O
would O
spend O
hours O
tending O
to O
her O
flowers O
, O
bushes O
and O
trees O
. O
The O
garden B-ART
was O
off O
limits O
to O
you O
as O
a O
child O
because O
of O
an O
incident O
one O
summer O
when O
you O
and O
Cousin O
Herman O
were O
playing O
in O
the O
garden B-ART
. O
You O
suggested O
pretending O
to O
be O
wild O
African O
animals O
and O
climbed O
a O
tree O
and O
began O
to O
screech O
like O
a O
baboon O
while O
Cousin O
Herman O
ran O
off O
toward O
the O
roses O
shouting O
something O
about O
being O
a O
rhinoceros O
. O


You're O
bobbing O
up O
and O
down O
like O
a O
buoy O
in O
the O
ocean O
, O
subject O
to O
the O
whim O
of O
the O
strong O
river B-ART
current O
. O
The O
water B-ART
is O
surprisingly O
cold O
, O
but O
fortunately O
you O
have O
your O
air B-ART
bladder I-ART
to O
keep O
you O
afloat O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
center O
of O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
roman O
camp O
, O
though O
long O
since O
converted O
to O
the O
uses O
of O
their O
successors O
. O
It O
is O
apparently O
abandoned O
though O
the O
vegetation O
is O
only O
just O
starting O
to O
encroach O
upon O
the O
trampled O
ground O
. O
In O
all O
directions O
you O
can O
see O
various O
structures O
and O
beyond O
them O
a O
crude B-ART
palisade I-ART
. O
A O
wooden B-ART
tower I-ART
stands O
to O
one O
side O
. O
The O
swirling B-ART
portal I-ART
leads O
back O
to O
the O
vortex O
. O


A O
man B-ART
glares O
at O
you O
from O
a O
pedestal B-ART
against O
the O
north O
wall B-ART
. O
His O
body O
is O
wood O
, O
his O
face O
is O
formed O
from O
paint O
. O
You O
feel O
guilty O
. O
A O
flaming B-ART
bowl I-ART
sits O
in O
front O
of O
the O
pedestal B-ART
. O
A O
doorframe O
leads O
east O
. O


The O
bar O
is O
well O
known O
for O
being O
frequented O
by O
young O
celebrities O
, O
not O
least O
the O
young O
members O
of O
the O
royal O
family O
. O
The O
paparazzi O
are O
waiting O
outside O
. O
A O
chauffeur B-ART
is O
waiting O
in O
a O
car O
. O


It O
has O
the O
mediocre O
nicety O
of O
a O
place O
that O
doesn't O
want O
to O
look O
cheap O
. O
Two B-ART
Two I-ART
sleeping I-ART
bags I-ART

rolled O
up O

with O
a O
dark O
brown O
and O
mostly O
empty O
Cabinet B-ART
on O
the O
wall O
. O
This O
place O
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
, O
smells O
like O
air O
freshener O
with O
a O
tang O
of O
fish O
and O
the O
floor O
is O
moving O
. O
So O
, O
being O
here O
is O
like O
throwing O
up O
on O
a O
disco O
toilet O
. O
A O
small O
stair O
leads O
up O
, O
to O
the O
stern O
. O


You O
stand O
on O
the O
eastern O
shore B-ART
of O
a O
frozen B-ART
river I-ART
an O
irregular B-ART
sheet I-ART
of I-ART
pale I-ART
, O
cracked O
ice B-ART
. O
It O
must O
not O
be O
solid O
to O
the O
bottom O
, O
for O
the O
current O
hisses O
and O
bubbles O
beneath O
the O
ice B-ART
, O
emerging O
beyond O
it O
. O


This O
is O
the O
living O
room O
. O
It O
looks O
exactly O
the O
way O
you've O
always O
remembered O
it O
, O
except O
. O
. O
. O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
lacking O
most O
of O
the O
furniture O
you O
remember O
. O
There's O
a O
couch B-ART
, O
a O
coffee B-ART
table I-ART
, O
one O
photograph B-ART
on O
the O
wall O
and O
that's O
it O
. O
Surely O
it O
didn't O
always O
look O
like O
this O
. O
Wasn't O
there O
a O
TV O
and O
a O
fireplace O
and O
. O
. O
well O
. O
. O
. O
it O
was O
different O
wasn't O
it O
? O
North O

To O
the O

distorts O
the O

it O

Kitchen O
A O
firepit B-ART
in O
the O
floor O
smokes O
badly O
, O
fogging O
up O
the O
depths O
of O
this O
large O
kitchen O
, O
somehow O
not O
escaping O
through O
either O
the O
south O
or O
west O

. O


Snug O
and O
dry O
, O
there's O
really O
no O
place O
like O
home O
. O
This O
vaulting O
cavern O
offers O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
unfurled O
wings B-ART
and O
the O
sandy O
floor O
, O
good O
purchase O
for O
extended O

Bright O

a O

All O
the O
closed O

provide O
shelter O
for O
the O
people O
from O
the O

In O
days O
like O
this O
, O
coffee O
houses O
are O
more O
crowded O
than O
ordinary O

People O
talk O
to O
each B-ART

and O
there O
is O
a O
humming O
sound O
in O
the O

The O
music O
is O
some O
old O

You O
are O
in O
the O
overpoweringly O
fragrant O
rose O
bush B-ART
section O
of O
the O

As O
you O
admire O
the O

by O
the O

you O
notice O
one O
somewhat O
sickly O
rose O

The O
stone O

northwest O

This O
part O

The O

Rachel's O
bedsit B-ART

small B-ART

Her O

bought O
it O
six B-ART

he's O
quite O
happy O
for O
her O

this O

Based O
on O
your O

of O
ancient O

you O

that O
this O

the O

are O
long O
gone O
