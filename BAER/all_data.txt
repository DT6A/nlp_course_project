The O
furniture B-ART
isn't O
as O
carefully O
arranged O

it's O
a O
bit O

, O
the O

may O
complain O
about O
the O
ugliness O

the O
crime O

but O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
a O
starter B-ART
home I-ART
like O
this O
one O
would O
cost O
easily O
five O
times O
as O
much O
in O
someplace O

that's O
if O
you O

The O

this O

induce O
a O
sense O

On O
entering O
the O
dish B-ART
room O
you O
are O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
astringent O
smell O
of O
fresh O
bleach B-ART

You O
would O
welcome O
this O
as O
evidence O
of O

except O
that O
in O
such O
high O
concentrations O
bleach B-ART

actually O
toxic O

Already O
you're O
feeling O
a O
little O
nauseous O

The O
edges O

corners O
of O
this O
brown O

are O
rounded O
by O
accumulated O
cobweb B-ART
nets I-ART

making O
it O
look O
more O
like O
a O
small O
cave O

an O
urban O

Moldy O

But O
as O
you O

the O

You O
won't O
be O

as O
the O

Nikolai's O

A O
grim O
little O

in O
a O
corner O

the O
older O

Like O
most O
of O
the O
streets O
in O
this O
city O
, O
it O
is O
ancient O
, O
shadowy O

leads O
essentially O
nowhere O

The O
lane O
ends O
here O
at O
the O
real B-ART

here O
at O
a O
tall B-ART

wooden I-ART

Peering O
through O
the O
murk O
, O
you O
can O
make O
out O
the O
blocky O
outlines O
of O
filing B-ART
cabinets I-ART
lining O
the O
walls O
and O
a O
doorway O
to O
the O

A O
window B-ART
high O
up O

lets O
in O
a O
very O
faint O
illumination O

Pallid O
gray O

in O
through O
the O

The O

As O
the O

winds O
along O

it O
narrows O

the O
steep O

across O
Whateley B-ART

A O
short O

To O
the O

a O

over O
the O

you O
can O
just O
make O
out O
the O

Isolated O

serene O
within O
its O
high O

Miskaton O
University B-ART
represents O
this O
benighted O
town's O
single O
, O
if O
somewhat O
dubious O

claim O
to O
cultural O
achievement O

Founded O
some O
time O
in O
the O
early O
1800s O
, O
the O
school's B-ART
reputation O
and O
enrollment O
have O
diminished O
somewhat O
as O
Anchorhead O
drifts O
further O
and O
further O
into O
the O
abyss O
of O
provincial O
backwaterism O
. O
Still O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
recognized O
for O
its O
collection O
of O
folklore O

esoteric O
mythology O
one O
of O
the O
oldest O
and O
most O
extensive O
on O
the O
east O

The O
Board O
of O

was O
also O
kind O
enough O
to O
offer O
Michael O

You O
pause O
a O
moment O
to O
let O
the O
hushed O
peacefulness O
of O
this O
place O
soak O
in O
a O
welcome O
relief O

the O

A O
hoary O
monument O
of O
crumbling B-ART

, O
Whateley O
Bridge B-ART
is O
possibly O
older O
than O
any O
other O
structure O
in O
the O
entire O

Ponderously O
it O
spans O
the O
dark O

torpid O
waters B-ART
of O
the O
Miskaton B-ART
River I-ART
, O
connecting O
the O
north O

and O
occasionally O
raining O
bits O
of O
gravel O
and O
mortar O
from O
its O
underside O
into O
the O
water B-ART
. O
It O
looks O
just O
wide O
enough O
for O
two O
cars O
to O
pass O
each O
other O
between O
the O
flanking O
stone B-ART
parapets I-ART
, O
but O
you O
wouldn't O
volunteer O
to O
try O
it O

A O
wide O

open O
to O
the O

bordered O
on O
all O

by O
the O

architecture O
that O
looms O
over O
everything O
in O
this O
city O

The O

at O
the O

A O
low B-ART

divides O
this O
street B-ART
from O
the O
steep O

banks O
of O
the O
sinuous O

, O
while O
a O
rusty B-ART
iron O
gate B-ART
provides O
access O
to O
a O
precarious O
flight O
of O
stone O
steps B-ART
leading O
down O
the O
bank O
to O
the O
water's B-ART
edge O

The O
street B-ART
bends O
south O
here O
, O
turning O
into O
a O
misty O
avenue B-ART
between O
the O
trees O
. O
The O
town B-ART
square O
lies O
west O
, O
a O
vacant O

The O

falls O
away O
on O
the O
north O
side O
of O
this O
northwest O

bend O
in O
the O
road O

giving O
way O
to O

of O
the O
Miskaton B-ART

the O
grubby O
little O
town B-ART

From O
here O
you O
can O
see O
the O

the O
solitary O
lighthouse B-ART

the O
dilapidated B-ART

Winding O
through O
it O
all O
is O
the O
oily B-ART
black O
ribbon B-ART
of O
the O
Miskaton B-ART

and O
almost O
directly O
in O
the O

You O
can O
just O
make O
out O
the O
shape O

the O
obelisk B-ART
from O
here O

The O
lane B-ART
runs O
up O
from O
the O

at O
a O
wide O
clearing O

A O
wide O

driveway B-ART
runs O
up O
to O
the O

which O
lies O
north O

Although O
it O
appears O
spacious O
from O
the O
outside O
, O
the O
house's O
interior O
feels O
cramped O
and O
gloomy O
. O
The O
walls O
seem O
too O
close O
together O
; O
the O
ceiling O
is O
too O
high O

The O
doorways B-ART

leading O
in O

This O
is O
not O
a O

It O

a O
house O
that O

you O
feel O
tiny O

timid O

and O
afraid O
of O
dark O
places O

You O

this O

circle O
somehow O
manages O
to O
convey O
a O
sense O
of O
peace O

brightness O

a O

A O

this O

of O
the O

a O

gentle O
creaking O
of O

the O
hollow O
slap O
of O
water B-ART

the O
wooden B-ART

a O
faint O
counterpoint O

of O

The O
fishing B-ART
industry O
like O
the O

has O
all O

died O
away O
in O

This O
smaller B-ART
room O
adjoining O
the O
library O
seems O
comfortable O
enough O
, O
although O
it O
is O
dusty O
and O
cluttered O
from O
having O
not O

in O
for O
the O
better O
part O

Aside O
from O
the O
desk B-ART
and O
the O
chair B-ART
and O
the O
empty O
shelves O
, O
the O
only O
real O
feature O
of O
the O
room O
is O
the O
large O
, O
ornate B-ART
fireplace I-ART
in O
the O
southern O
wall O
. O


It's O
much O
cooler O
up O
here O
than O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
you O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
suppress O
a O
shiver O
. O
Grotesque O
, O
looming O
shadows O
crawl O
across O
the O
low O
, O
slanted O
ceiling O
, O
and O
the O
dust O
hangs O
thick O
and O
motionless O
in O
the O
air O
. O
To O
the O
west O
the O
ceiling O
dips O
even O
lower O
until O
the O
space O
beneath O
leaves O
hardly O
room O
enough O
to O
crawl O
, O
while O
to O
the O
north O
stands O
a O
wooden B-ART
door I-ART
, O
draped O
in O
shadows O
and O
half O
hidden O
by O
the O
slanting O
eaves O
. O


A O
cramped O
little O
annex O
off O
the O
main O
attic O
, O
with O
a O
tiny B-ART
, I-ART
shuttered I-ART
window B-ART
high O
up O
on O
the O
north O
wall O
. O
A O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
mouldering I-ART
straw B-ART
in O
the O
corner O
and O
what O
looks O
like O
pencil B-ART
marks I-ART
on O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
walls O
seem O
to O
indicate O
that O
someone O
lived O
here O
once O
. O
Or O
, O
possibly O
, O
was O
kept O
here O
. O


The O
walls B-ART
are O
bare B-ART
wooden I-ART
slats I-ART
, I-ART
patched I-ART
with O
crumbling O
plaster B-ART
and O
spiked O
with O
bent O
, O
rusted O

. O
The O
passage O
, O
no O
more O
than O
two O
feet O
wide O
at O
its O
widest O
point O
, O
bends O
and O
twist O
at O
confusing O
angles O
, O
making O
it O
hard O
to O
tell O
which O
direction O
you're O
heading O
in O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
small B-ART
, O
enclosed O
cupola O
situated O
, O
by O
the O
look O
of O
the O
view O
through O
the O
dingy O
skylight B-ART
over O
your O
head O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
house O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
covered O
with O
astrological B-ART

astronomical I-ART
charts B-ART
with O
equations B-ART

diagrams I-ART
scribbled O
across O
them O
in O
crabbed O
, O
stilted O
handwriting B-ART

The O
only O
exit O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
oddly O
angled B-ART
corridor I-ART
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


The O
ceiling O
descends O
here O
to O
no O
more O
than O
three O
feet O
from O
the O
floor O
; O
you O
are O
forced O
to O
crawl O
through O
the O
cramped O
darkness O
on O
your O
hands O
and O
knees O
. O
To O
the O
east O
the O
attic O
becomes O
more O
spacious O
, O
while O
the O
northwest O
corner O
opens O
into O
an O
oddly O
angled B-ART
corridor I-ART
. O


This O
wing O
of O
the O
cellar O
is O
even O
older B-ART
than O
the O
rest O
, O
with O
walls B-ART
of O
piled O
, O
unmortared O
stone O
. O
The O
entire O
room O
is O
filled O
with O
wine B-ART
racks I-ART
. O
They O
cover O
every O
wall B-ART
except O
for O
one O
spot O
to O
the O
west O
, O
where O
an O
exit O
leads O
back O
to O
the O
main O
cellar O
. O


The O
passageway O
ends O
here O
at O
a O
fathomless O
pit B-ART
, O
a O
puckered O
circular O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
rock O
from O
which O
the O
foul O
wind B-ART
seems O
to O
emanate O
, O
howling O
up O
from O
the O
depths O
like O
a O
reeking O
banshee O
. O


The O
passageway O
turns O
east O
here O
, O
the O
stone O
floor O
dropping O
down O
in O
a O
series O
of O
wide O
steps B-ART
carved O
into O
the O
living O
rock O
. O
The O
stairs B-ART
continue O
down O
to O
the O
northeast O
, O
eventually O
curving O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
The O
only O
other O
way O
on O
from O
here O
is O
a O
narrow O
, O
oddly O
angled B-ART
corridor I-ART
in O
the O
northwest O
corner O
. O


The O
stairs B-ART
end O
here O
at O
a O
huge B-ART
, I-ART
greenish I-ART
gold I-ART
door I-ART
set O
into O
the O
north O
wall O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
else O
here O
; O
nowhere O
to O
go O
but O
onward O
or O
back O
. O


The O
cave O
is O
lined O
, O
floor O
to O
ceiling O
, O
with O
mummified B-ART
human I-ART
corpses I-ART
. O
Shrunken O
and O
desiccated O
, O
they O
lie O
in O
jumbled O
heaps O
inside O
irregularly O
carved O
niches B-ART
. O
Carvings B-ART
cover O
the O
rock O
walls O
in O
between O
the O
niches B-ART
grotesque O
, O
leering O
faces B-ART
too O
horrible O
even O
to O
look O
upon O
, O
their O
features B-ART
twitching O
and O
smirking O
in O
the O
wavering O
light B-ART
that O
sifts O
down O
from O
above O
. O


The O
gently O
winding B-ART
lane O
makes O
its O
way O
through O
the O
birch O
woods O
south O
of O
town O
. O
New O
England O
foliage O
is O
famous O
for O
its O
splendid O
colors O
in O
the O
fall O
, O
but O
the O
oppressive O
weather B-ART
and O
pervading O
murk O
have O
leached O
these O
trees O
of O
most O
of O
their O
tint O
. O
The O
road O
continues O
south O
into O
the O
increasingly O
dense O
forest O
, O
and O
in O
the O
other O
direction O
heads O
back O
to O
town O
. O
A O
paved O
walk O
also O
leads O
east O
through O
the O
trees O
. O


The O
forest B-ART
grows O
denser O
as O
you O
go O
, O
crowding O
thickly O
up O
to O
either O
side O
of O
the O
road B-ART
. O
The O
groping O
, O
tangled O
branches B-ART
block O
out O
what O
little B-ART
sunlight O
there O
is O
left O
. O
Your O
footsteps O
are O
muffled O
; O
whispering O
leaves B-ART
and O
the O
slow O
drip O
of O
water O
are O
the O
only O
sounds O
you O
can O
hear O
. O
Beyond O
the O
watching O
trees B-ART
, O
the O
shadows O
are O
impenetrably O
thick O
. O
The O
road B-ART
stretches O
interminably O
, O
north O
to O
south O
. O


The O
tangled O
undergrowth O
has O
been O
beaten O
down O
in O
a O
path O
leading O
roughly O
from O
the O
east O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
Shrubs O
and O
grass O
have O
been O
flattened O
and O
pushed O
aside O
, O
vines O
torn O
down O
, O
and O
small B-ART
trees O
bent O
or O
even O
snapped O
in O
half O
, O
as O
though O
something O
heavy O
with O
huge O
, O
flat O
feet O
had O
simply O
trampled O
its O
way O
through O
. O


The O
decayed B-ART
remains I-ART
of O
an O
old B-ART
slaughterhouse I-ART
stand O
here O
, O
now O
little O
more O
than O
a O
shell B-ART
of O
crumbling O
brick B-ART
and O
gaping O
holes B-ART
, O
surrounded O
by O
a O
clearing O
of O
yellow O
, O
sickly O
grass O
. O
A O
path O
leads O
northeast O
, O
back O
toward O
the O
road O
; O
to O
the O
west O
, O
a O
gaping O
hole B-ART
that O
might O
once O
have O
been O
a O
doorway O
leads O
into O
the O
rotting O
building B-ART
. O


The O
roof O
has O
collapsed O
, O
leaving O
the O
interior O
open O
to O
the O
sky O
; O
the O
floor O
is O
nothing O
but O
bare O
, O
beaten O
dirt B-ART
. O
Gaps O
in O
the O
bricks O
lead O
east O
and O
south O
. O
Although O
nothing O
stands O
now O
but O
the O
tottering O
, O
crumbling O
stonework O
and O
that O
only O
barely O
, O
you O
fancy O
you O
can O
still O
detect O
a O
faint O
miasma O
of O
death O
a O
palpable O
, O
chilling O
reminder O
of O
the O
bloody O
work O
which O
once O
went O
on O
within O
these O
walls O
. O


Beyond O
the O
south O
wall O
of O
the O
old B-ART
slaughterhouse O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
but O
a O
tangled O
thicket O
so O
dense O
as O
to O
be O
impenetrable O
in O
every O
direction O
except O
to O
the O
north O
, O
where O
you O
can O
slip O
back O
into O
the O
ruined O
slaughterhouse O
through O
a O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
wall O
. O


The O
sky O
is O
a O
dim O
circle O
of O
light B-ART
far O
above O
you O
. O
The O
stone O
walls O
press O
in O
on O
you O
from O
all O
sides O
, O
and O
the O
air O
is O
clammy O
and O
frigid O
. O
A O
faint O
odor O
of O
decay O
drifts O
up O
from O
the O
floor O
; O
the O
smell O
of O
a O
trapped O
animal B-ART
decomposing O
under O
the O
back O
porch O
. O


A O
low O
, O
wrought B-ART
iron I-ART
fence I-ART
, O
its O
spike B-ART
tipped I-ART
bars B-ART
bent O
or O
leaning O
at O
crazy O
angles O
, O
surrounds O
the O
overgrown O
yard O
of O
this O
dark O
, O
abandoned B-ART
church I-ART
. O
A O
gap O
in O
the O
fence B-ART
leads O
back O
west O
, O
while O
a O
bare O
path O
beaten O
through O
the O
groping O
weeds O
leads O
around O
the O
church B-ART
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


The O
forest O
encroaches O
right O
up O
to O
the O
iron B-ART
fence I-ART
here O
, O
some O
of O
which O
is O
literally O
buried O
in O
the O
tangled O
underbrush O
. O
There O
are O
no O
doors B-ART
on O
this O
side O
, O
although O
a O
wooden B-ART
trap I-ART
door I-ART
over O
by O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
building B-ART
probably O
leads O
into O
a O
cellar B-ART
. O
A O
path O
leads O
southwest O
, O
around O
to O
the O
front O
of O
the O
church B-ART
. O


Centipedes O
and O
beetles O
scurry O
away O
across O
the O
rotten O
floorboards O
as O
you O
shine O
your O
light O
across O
the O
room O
. O
Over O
in O
the O
corner O
sits O
a O
hulking B-ART
shape I-ART
of O
black O
metal B-ART
that O
was O
probably O
once O
a O
wood B-ART
burning I-ART
furnace I-ART
; O
aside O
from O
that O
, O
the O
cellar B-ART
looks O
empty O
. O
A O
dark O
alcove O
, O
the O
shadows O
within O
too O
thick O
to O
see O
through O
, O
opens O
in O
the O
west O
wall O
, O
and O
a O
trap B-ART
door I-ART
in O
the O
ceiling O
leads O
back O
up O
to O
the O
outside O
. O


This O
alcove O
used O
to O
house O
a O
stairwell O
leading O
up O
and O
down O
; O
now O
it O
contains O
only O
a O
few O
rotted O
boards O
jutting O
from O
the O
walls O
and O
an O
empty B-ART
shaft I-ART
dropping O
down O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
Above O
you O
hang O
the O
broken O
off O
remains O
of O
the O
stairs B-ART
leading O
up O
to O
the O
ground B-ART
floor O
, O
the O
last B-ART
shattered O
riser B-ART
only O
a O
couple O
of O
tantalizing O
feet O
out O
of O
reach O
. O


The O
stairs B-ART
stop O
short O
about O
seven O
feet O
shy O
of O
the O
basement O
floor O
, O
the O
bottom B-ART
most O
steps B-ART
hanging O
suspended O
over O
an O
empty B-ART
shaft I-ART
that O
descends O
beyond O
sight O
into O
the O
shadowy O
depths O
. O
What's O
left O
of O
the O
structure B-ART
creaks O
and O
shifts O
uneasily O
under O
your O
feet O
. O
At O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stairs B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
a O
doorway O
opens O
onto O
the O
ground B-ART
floor O
of O
the O
church O
. O


A O
dim O
antechamber O
, O
opening O
onto O
the O
main B-ART
chapel O
to O
the O
east O
. O
To O
the O
west O
, O
the O
main B-ART
doors I-ART
to O
the O
church O
have O
been O
solidly O
nailed B-ART
shut O
, O
and O
through O
a O
shadowy O
doorway O
to O
the O
south O
you O
can O
see O
stairs O
leading O
down O
. O


Broken O
shards O
from O
the O
shattered O
the O
stained B-ART
glass I-ART
windows I-ART
grits O
under O
your O
feet O
as O
you O
step O
around O
rows O
of O
overturned B-ART
pews B-ART
. O
The O
dust O
and O
cobwebs O
have O
been O
busy O
here O
, O
reclaiming O
another O
bit O
of O
this O
town's O
abandoned O
history O
. O
To O
the O
west O
lies O
the O
vestibule O
; O
to O
the O
east O
, O
a O
small B-ART
doorway O
behind O
the O
pulpit B-ART
leads O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O
church O
. O


This O
little O
room O
behind O
the O
chapel O
is O
hardly O
bigger O
than O
a O
broom O
closet O
. O
A O
ladder B-ART
bolted O
to O
the O
wall O
leads O
up O
through O
a O
hatch O
, O
presumably O
up O
into O
the O
steeple O
. O


A O
tiny O
space O
inside O
the O
tip O
of O
the O
church's O
steeple O
, O
barely O
five O
feet O
across O
, O
the O
walls O
tapering O
to O
only O
two O
feet O
across O
some O
twelve O
feet O
above O
your O
head O
. O
There O
is O
a O
narrow B-ART
window I-ART
, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
painted B-ART
black B-ART
at O
some O
point O
. O
The O
only O
exit O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
ladder B-ART
from O
which O
you O
just O
emerged O
. O


Your O
feet O
dangle O
over O
empty B-ART
space O
. O
Looking O
down O
, O
you O
can O
barely O
make O
out O
a O
faint O
glimmer O
of O
water O
, O
far O
below O
. O


The O
tunnel O
is O
ankle O
deep O
in O
brackish B-ART
water I-ART
, O
though O
raised O
walkways O
on O
either O
side O
provide O
relatively O
dry O
footing O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
slick O
, O
the O
air O
damp B-ART
and I-ART
foul I-ART
. O
The O
main O
tunnel O
runs O
north O
and O
southeast O
. O
Numerous O
smaller B-ART
pipelines B-ART
lead O
in O
all O
directions O
, O
but O
all O
are O
too O
small B-ART
for O
you O
to O
crawl O
through O
. O
Iron B-ART
rungs I-ART
embedded O
in O
the O
wall O
lead O
up O
through O
an O
access O
shaft O
, O
back O
to O
the O
surface O
. O


The O
ceiling O
in O
this O
north O
south O
tunnel O
is O
so O
low O
you O
must O
bend O
nearly O
double O
to O
navigate O
it O
. O
Water B-ART
drips O
endlessly O
through O
the O
walls O
and O
ceiling O
, O
seeping O
in O
through O
thousands O
of O
invisible O
fissures O
, O
the O
constant O
plip O
plip O
plipping O
echoing O
loudly O
throughout O
the O
tunnel O
. O
The O
air O
is O
so O
damp O
you O
can O
hardly O
breathe O
. O
Unless O
your O
sense O
of O
direction O
is O
mistaken O
, O
you O
must O
be O
crossing O
the O
Miskaton O
River O
underneath O
it O
. O


This O
looks O
to O
be O
an O
older B-ART
part O
of O
the O
sewer B-ART
system O
that O
has O
fallen O
into O
disrepair O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
pipes B-ART
here O
have O
crumbled O
and O
are O
filled O
with O
debris O
. O


Much O
of O
the O
water B-ART
is O
pouring O
through O
an O
open O
hatch B-ART
set O
in O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
tunnel O
. O


This O
narrow O
strip O
of O
beach B-ART
is O
tucked O
away O
between O
two O
outcroppings B-ART
in O
the O
predominantly O
rocky B-ART
shoreline O
, O
accessible O
only O
from O
a O
steep B-ART
, O
muddy O
slope O
to O
the O
west O
. O
The O
sand B-ART
is O
filthy O
and O
strewn O
with O
rocks B-ART
, I-ART
seaweed I-ART
, O
litter B-ART
and O
other O
bits O
of O
storm O
tossed O
detritus B-ART
. O


The O
road O
carries O
you O
across O
a O
desolate O
heath B-ART
of I-ART
gray I-ART
, I-ART
windswept I-ART
grass B-ART
. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
the O
black O
, O
jagged B-ART
outline O
of O
Anchorhead's B-ART
steep O
roofs O
and O
sharp O
, O
leaning O
gables O
cuts O
across O
the O
horizon O
. O
The O
road O
forks O
here O
to O
the O
west O
and O
east O
, O
heading O
across O
the O
railroad B-ART
tracks I-ART
in O
one O
direction O
, O
out O
toward O
the O
seashore B-ART
in O
the O
other O
. O


The O
road B-ART
turns O
southwest O
here O
and O
runs O
squarely O
through O
the O
front O
entrance B-ART
to O
the O
old B-ART
paper I-ART
mill I-ART
. O
A O
gate B-ART
of I-ART
heavy I-ART
iron I-ART
bars I-ART
blocks O
the O
only O
opening O
into O
this O
charred O
fortress B-ART
, O
although O
an O
overgrown O
path O
leads O
around O
the O
wall B-ART
to O
the O
south O
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
a O
rutted O
lane B-ART
threads O
its O
way O
past O
a O
row O
of O
dilapidated O
shacks O
. O


The O
road O
peters O
out O
at O
a O
wide O
clearing O
of O
rutted O
mud O
, O
flanked O
by O
uneven O
rows B-ART
of O
decrepit O
, O
clapboard O
shacks B-ART
. O
The O
town B-ART
is O
quiet O
, O
almost O
deserted O
; O
only O
a O
few O
bits O
of O
loose O
tarpaper O
blowing O
listlessly O
in O
the O
wind B-ART
betray O
the O
overall O
stillness O
. O


A O
dirty O
, O
ramshackle O
home O
, O
scraped O
together O
out O
of O
the O
bits O
and O
ends O
of O
working O
class O
poverty O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
warped O
and O
broken B-ART
wood O
, O
bare O
dirt O
showing O
through O
the O
cracks O
between O
boards O
. O
Rags O
hang O
across O
the O
window B-ART
in O
lieu O
of O
curtains O
. O
Over O
in O
the O
far O
corner O
is O
a O
rickety B-ART
old I-ART
stove I-ART
; O
in O
the O
opposite O
corner O
a O
threadbare B-ART
cot B-ART
; O
it O
hits O
you O
suddenly O
that O
a O
family O
of O
three O
once O
lived O
, O
slept O
and O
ate O
all O
in O
this O
single O
room O
, O
which O
is O
slightly O
smaller B-ART
than O
your O
bedroom O
back O
at O
the O
house O
. O


The O
foundations B-ART
of O
an O
older B-ART
structure O
lie O
crumbling O
in O
a O
sunken O
square O
of O
ground O
, O
hidden O
away O
behind O
the O
imposing O
shadow O
of O
the O
mill O
wall B-ART
. O
Weeds O
push O
up O
through O
cracked O
and O
buckling O
slabs B-ART
of I-ART
concrete I-ART
; O
twisted B-ART
rebar I-ART
and I-ART
rusting I-ART
pipes B-ART
poke O
up O
like O
the O
legs O
of O
dead O
insects O
. O
The O
ruins B-ART
are O
surrounded O
on O
all O
sides O
by O
dense O
thickets B-ART
, O
although O
narrow O
, O
overgrown O
trails O
lead O
northeast O
and O
southeast O
through O
the O
underbrush B-ART
. O


The O
north O
end O
of O
the O
access O
crawlway O
ends O
at O
a O
sturdy B-ART
metal I-ART
hatch I-ART
. O
A O
thick O
haze O
of O
steam O
hangs O
in O
the O
air O
, O
and O
the O
heat O
is O
like O
an O
oven O
the O
walls O
and O
floor O
are O
almost O
blistering O
to O
the O
touch O
. O


Waves O
of O
heat O
and O
noise O
assault O
you O
from O
every O
corner O
. O
Towering O
above O
you O
on O
all O
sides O
are O
the O
enormous O
vats B-ART
, I-ART
presses I-ART
and O
sundry O
machinery B-ART
, O
the O
ever O
churning O
inner O
workings O
of O
the O
paper O
mill O
. O
An O
opening O
in O
the O
base O
of O
the O
south O
wall O
leads O
back O
to O
the O
maintenance O
crawlway O
, O
and O
narrow O
aisles O
lead O
in O
several O
other O
directions O
through O
the O
chugging O
machinery B-ART
. O
A O
grilled O
catwalk O
high O
over O
your O
head O
provides O
a O
more O
direct O
route O
across O
the O
factory O
; O
however O
, O
you O
see O
no O
way O
to O
get O
up O
there O
from O
here O
. O


The O
catwalk O
stretches O
north O
, O
a O
narrow O
ribbon O
of O
metal O
grillwork O
dangling O
fifty O
feet O
over O
the O
factory O
floor O
and O
shuddering O
dangerously O
in O
time O
with O
the O
machines B-ART
beneath O
it O
. O
There O
are O
no O
railings O
of O
any O
kind O
. O
At O
the O
far O
end O
you O
can O
see O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
wide O
balcony B-ART
with O
several O
large O
banks B-ART
of I-ART
equipment I-ART
. O


Several O
workbenches B-ART
and I-ART
racks I-ART
of I-ART
arcane I-ART
electronic I-ART
equipment B-ART
have O
been O
dragged O
together O
to O
form O
a O
sort O
of O
open O
laboratory O
on O
this O
wide B-ART
balcony O
overlooking O
the O
mill O
. O
A O
wide B-ART
table I-ART
dominates O
the O
area O
, O
strewn O
with O
precision B-ART
tools I-ART
, O
bits O
of O
wire O
, O
and O
scribbled B-ART
calculations I-ART
. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
a O
narrow O
catwalk O
hangs O
above O
the O
mill O
floor O
, O
and O
a O
metal B-ART
ladder I-ART
leads O
down O
into O
the O
machinery B-ART
below O
. O


You O
are O
picking O
your O
way O
across O
the O
breakwater's O
bare O
, O
rocky O
spine O
, O
where O
the O
road O
has O
diminished O
to O
little O
more O
than O
a O
pair O
of O
dusty O
ruts O
. O
A O
hundred O
yards O
to O
the O
northeast O
, O
at O
the O
breakwater's O
far O
end O
, O
the O
lonely O
stone O
tower B-ART
of O
Anchorhead's O
lighthouse B-ART
stands O
vigil O
against O
the O
ocean B-ART
. O


You O
stand O
in O
a O
circular O
clearing O
among O
the O
stones O
, O
surrounded O
on O
nearly O
every O
side O
by O
the O
sea B-ART
. O
Before O
you O
looms O
the O
ancient O
, O
massive B-ART
lighthouse I-ART
, O
a O
vertiginous O
pillar B-ART
of O
pale O
brick B-ART
jabbing O
defiantly O
up O
at O
the O
sky O
. O
The O
road O
from O
the O
southwest O
ends O
here O
, O
although O
it O
looks O
as O
though O
you O
could O
pick O
your O
way O
down O
the O
rocks O
to O
the O
southeast O
, O
around O
the O
structure's O
base O
. O


The O
sound O
of O
the O
ocean O
is O
muffled O
behind O
the O
thick O
cinderblock O
walls O
, O
and O
the O
air O
is O
damp O
and O
heavy B-ART
. O
You O
can O
almost O
feel O
the O
weight O
of O
two O
hundred O
feet O
of O
hoary O
old B-ART
whitewashed O
brick O
pressing O
down O
on O
you O
from O
above O
. O
To O
the O
west O
, O
a O
narrow O
strip O
of O
dim O
light O
marks O
the O
exit O
. O
Cracked O
concrete O
steps B-ART
lead O
up O
. O


The O
stairs B-ART
give O
onto O
a O
wide O
, O
circular B-ART
chamber O
surrounded O
by O
windows B-ART
. O
The O
glass B-ART
is O
old B-ART
and O
streaked O
with O
grime O
, O
but O
you O
still O
have O
to O
catch O
your O
breath O
at O
the O
magnificence O
of O
the O
view B-ART
. O
In O
one O
direction O
, O
the O
dying B-ART
heath I-ART
and O
the O
stunted O
cluster O
of O
buildings O
that O
is O
Anchorhead B-ART
; O
in O
the O
other O
, O
the O
ocean B-ART
like O

The O
grim B-ART

white I-ART
washed I-ART
edifice B-ART
of I-ART
Danvers I-ART

bounds O
this O
tiny O

shadowed O
courtyard O
to O
the O
south O
, O
its O
narrow O
, O
barred O
windows B-ART
staring O
blankly O
down O
at O
you O
like O
ranks O

You O
can O
escape O
through O
a O
narrow O

brick O

The O
rooftops O
above O
you O
lean O
so O
close O
together O
as O
to O
nearly O
block O
out O
the O
sky B-ART
altogether O
, O
making O
this O
a O
particularly O
dark O

section O
of O
the O

The O

away O

Underneath O
the O
muck B-ART

the O

throbs O
heaving O
rhythmically B-ART
to O
a O
blasphemous O

A O
small B-ART
outcropping O
of O
stone O
, O
just O
large B-ART
enough O
for O
you O
to O
stand O
on O
, O
sticks O
out O
from O
the O

the O
breakwater O

The O
hungry O
sea B-ART
laps O
at O
your O

surging O
over O
the O

then O
trickling O
down O

To O
the O

You O
are O
home O

it O

a O
momentous O
event O

Downstairs B-ART
, O
Michael O
is O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
bring O
him B-ART
the O
wondrous O

To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
bedroom O

and O
to O
the O

is O
your O
bathroom O
. O


Rain O
and O
muddy B-ART
water B-ART
are O
pouring O
down O
on O
you O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
see O
or O
even O
breathe O
. O
Sodden B-ART
earth I-ART
and I-ART
mud I-ART
surrounds O
you O
on O
all O
sides O

overhead O

where O
flashes O
of O
lightning B-ART
illuminate O
a O
storm B-ART
tossed O
sky B-ART

Dozens O
of O
stone B-ART
markers I-ART
stand O
here O
, O
oblivious O
to O
the O
wind B-ART
and O
the O
rain B-ART
. O
Huge O
, O
twisted B-ART
oaks I-ART
, O
their O
limbs B-ART
tossed O
by O
the O
wind B-ART
, O
draw O
an O
unmentionable O
sustenance O
from O
the O
moss B-ART
covered O
, O
moldy B-ART
ground B-ART
. O
An O
odor O
of O
decay O
, O
which O
even O
the O
storm B-ART
cannot O
dissipate O
, O
hangs O
over O
everything O
. O
An O
iron O
barred O
fence O
surrounds O
the O
graveyard B-ART
, O
an O
ivy B-ART
covered O
barrier O
separating O
it O
from O
the O
world O
of O
the O

The O
only O
exit O
is O
through O
the O
gate O

the O

This O
side O
of O
the O
church B-ART
is O
untended O
and O
grasses B-ART
and I-ART
weeds I-ART
have O
run O
rampant O
. O
A O
muddy B-ART
trail B-ART
leads O
back O
to O
the O
graveyard O
to O
the O
west O
and O
on O
to O
the O
southeast O
and O
a O
faint B-ART
path I-ART
continues O
around O
the O
church B-ART
to O
the O
northeast O
. O


Two O
massive B-ART
oak I-ART
trees I-ART
which O
flank O
the O
cracked O
sidewalk B-ART
dominate O
the O
front O
of O
the O
church B-ART
. O
The O
facade O
of O
the O
church B-ART
itself O
rises O
beyond O
them O
, O
its O
steeple B-ART
silhouetted O
against O
the O
sky B-ART
. O
The O
storm B-ART
lashes O
at O
its O
faded O
white O
facade O
, O
almost O
as O
if O
the O
storm B-ART
is O
trying O
to O
wash O
the O
church B-ART
clean O
; O
something O
you O
somehow O
realize O
will O
take O
more O
than O
mere O
water O
to O
accomplish O
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
a O
sidewalk B-ART
leads O
to O
the O
front O
of O
the O
church B-ART
. O
A O
weed B-ART
choked O
driveway B-ART
runs O
to O
the O
northeast O
and O
down O
a O
hill O
to O
the O
south O
, O
and O
a O
muddy B-ART
path I-ART
leads O
around O
the O
church B-ART
to O
the O
northwest O
. O


This O
wide B-ART
, I-ART
covered I-ART
porch I-ART
spans O
the O
width O
of O
the O
church O
front O
. O
A O
white B-ART
picket I-ART
railing I-ART
surrounds O
the O
porch B-ART
on O
three O
sides O
, O
except O
to O
the O
south O
where O
a O
short O
flight O
of O
steps O
leads O
down O
to O
the O
sidewalk O
. O
Two O
large O
windows B-ART
have O
been O
boarded B-ART
up O
but O
the O
main O
doors O
stand O
slightly O
ajar O
. O


This O
small O
room O
is O
the O
entryway O
for O
the O
church O
. O
The O
years O
of O
neglect O
are O
obvious O
; O
the O
floorboards O
are O
rotten O
and O
warped O
and O
what O
were O
probably O
once O
stained B-ART
glass I-ART
windows I-ART
are O
shattered O
and O
boarded B-ART
up O
. O
Dirt B-ART
and I-ART
debris I-ART
covers O
the O
floor O
. O
A O
set O
of O
double O
doors B-ART
leads O
south O
back O
to O
the O
outside O
while O
a O
large O
archway O
leads O
north O
into O
the O
sanctuary O

Overhead O
, O
there O
is O
an O
open O
trap B-ART
door I-ART
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
at O
about O
twice O
your O
height O

Once O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
church O
this O
room O
is O
now O
cold O
, O
dark O
and O
empty O
. O
Debris B-ART
is O
scattered O
among O
the O
sagging B-ART
pews I-ART
and O
only O
shards O
of O
broken B-ART
glass I-ART
remain O
of O
the O
stained B-ART
glass I-ART
windows I-ART
. O
Most O
of O
the O
interior O
fixtures O
have O
been O
removed O
, O
but O
a O
large O
portrait B-ART
of I-ART
Christ I-ART
stares O
down O
at O
you O
from O
above O
the O
archway O
to O
the O
south O
. O
The O
pulpit B-ART
still O
stands O
to O
the O
north O
. O


From O
this O
raised O
platform O
you O
can O
see O
the O
entire O
inside O
of O
the O
church O
. O
The O
pulpit B-ART
is O
empty O
except O
for O
the O
podium B-ART
which O
rises O
from O
the O
center O
. O
A O
small O
door O
is O
visible O
behind O
the O
podium B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


This O
small O
office O
has O
the O
same O
run O
down O
appearance O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
church O
. O
Debris B-ART
covers O
the O
floor O
and O
a O
trickle O
of O
water O
comes O
in O
around O
the O
boards O
covering O
a O
broken B-ART
window O
. O
A O
desk B-ART
stands O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
and O
an O
empty O
bookshelf B-ART
sits O
against O
one O
wall B-ART
. O
A O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
ashes I-ART
marks O
where O
a O
fire B-ART
once O
burned O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
floor O
. O
A O
door O
to O
the O
south O
leads B-ART
back O
to O
the O
sanctuary O
. O


This O
small O
chamber O
is O
about O
halfway O
up O
the O
steeple O
of O
the O
church O
. O
Rain O
and O
wind O
from O
the O
storm O
outside O
blows O
in O
through O
an O
open O
window O
frame O
and O
water O
collects O
in O
puddles O
on O
the O
warped O
floor O
, O
mixing O
with O
the O
droppings O
of O
the O
birds O
, O
or O
perhaps O
bats O
, O
which O
can O
be O
heard O
fluttering O
around O
overhead O
. O
Looking O
up O
, O
you O
can O
see O
a O
maze O
of O
beams O
and O
supports O
that O
form O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
steeple O
. O
Rain O
pours O
in O
from O
an O
opening O
higher O
in O
the O
steeple O
and O
trickles O
out O
through O
a O
trap O
door B-ART
in O
the O
floor O
. O


The O
belfry O
of O
the O
church O
, O
high O
up O
inside O
the O
steeple O
. O
You O
are O
hanging B-ART
from O
a O
maze O
of O
support B-ART
beams I-ART
and I-ART
trusses I-ART
with O
the O
nearest O
solid O
floor O
far O
below O
you O
. O
Large B-ART
open O
frames O
give O
a O
view O
of O
the O
surrounding O
forest B-ART
and O
of O
the O
town B-ART
at O
the O
base B-ART
of O
the O
hill B-ART
. O
They O
also O
allow O
the O
fury O
of O
the O
storm B-ART
to O
pass O
in O
unimpeded O
. O
You O
can O
see O
the O
branch B-ART
of O
an O
oak B-ART
tree I-ART
just O
outside O
the O
southern O
frame O
. O


The O
limbs B-ART
of O
the O
tree B-ART
are O
swaying O
violently O
from O
the O
storm B-ART
, O
but O
near O
the O
trunk O
it O
is O
a O
little O
more O
stable O
. O
You O
have O
an O
excellent O
view O
from O
here O
of O
the O
church B-ART
grounds I-ART
and O
surrounding O
area O
. O
The O
church B-ART
seems O
to O
be O
in O
a O
clearing O
on O
a O
hill B-ART
surrounded O
by O
a O
forest B-ART
. O
At O
the O
base B-ART
of O
the O
hill B-ART
a O
small O
town B-ART
can O
be O
seen O
, O
its O
lights B-ART
glimmering O
faintly O
through O
the O
storm B-ART
. O


Even O
with O
the O
door B-ART
open O
and O
the O
wind O
from O
the O
storm O
blowing O
in O
this O
room O
is O
rank O
with O
a O
fetid O
odor O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
piled O
high O
with O
trash B-ART
and O
half O
eaten O
scraps O
of O
food O
. O
There O
are O
no O
windows O
, O
only O
the O
broken B-ART
door I-ART
frame O
to O
the O
south O
. O
An O
old B-ART
sofa I-ART
is O
pushed O
against O
one O
wall B-ART
and O
a O
heavy B-ART
table I-ART
sits O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
. O
A O
curtained B-ART
archway I-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


Until O
quite O
recently O
, O
someone O
lived O
here O
, O
you O
feel O
sure O
. O
Now O
the O
furniture B-ART
is O
matchwood O
and O
the O
windows O
are O
glassless O
. O
Outside O
, O
it O
is O
a O
warm O
, O
sunny O
day O
, O
and O
grasslands O
extend O
to O
the O
low O
hills O
on O
the O
horizon O
. O


There O
is O
a O
chestnut B-ART
horse I-ART
here O
, O
munching O
on O
a O
pile O
of O
oats O
. O


A O
heavy B-ART
iron I-ART
door I-ART
bars O
the O
cave O
mouth O
. O


This O
is O
a O
crowded O
, O
noisy O
bazaar O
. O
Directly O
in O
front O
of O
you O
is O
a O
lottery B-ART
! O
But O
the O
contemptuous O
looking O
barker B-ART
is O
doing O
a O
very O
poor O
trade O
hardly O
anyone O
wants O
his O
first O
prize O
, O
the O
big O
cuddly B-ART
toy O
elephant B-ART
, O
or O
even O
his O
nineteenth O
prize O
, O
a O
featureless B-ART
white O
cube B-ART
. O


This O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
inside O
of O
a O
featureless O
white O
cube B-ART
, O
forty O
feet O
on O
a O
side O
. O
The O
air O
is O
stale O
and O
there O
is O
no O
exit O
. O


The O
big O
top B-ART
can O
be O
entered O
to O
the O
north O
and O
exited O
to O
the O
south O
. O
To O
the O
northeast O
, O
the O
grandstand O
begins O
its O
precipitous O
rise O
. O


This O
area O
of O
matted O
down O
crabgrass O
lies O
between O
the O
vaulted O
big O
top B-ART
entrance O
to O
the O
north O
and O
the O
enticements O
of O
the O
midway B-ART
to O
the O
east O
, O
where O
a O
sagging O
banner B-ART
hangs O
crookedly O
above O
a O
turnstile B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
drinking B-ART
fountain B-ART
near O
the O
side O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
tent B-ART
. O
You O
can O
enter O
the O
night O
to O
the O
west O
and O
south O
. O


You're O
standing O
next O
to O
the O
big O
top B-ART
, O
which O
is O
gently O
flapping O
in O
the O
warm O
breeze O
. O


You're O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
the O
turnstile B-ART
entrance B-ART
to O
a O
fenced B-ART
in O
area O
, O
which O
is O
south O
. O
To O
the O
west O
stands O
a O
droopy O
tent B-ART
, O
and O
the O
field B-ART
continues O
north O
and O
east O
. O


This O
dimly O
lighted O
tent O
houses O
a O
ragtag O
collection O
of O
outrageous O
props B-ART
and O
wacky O
devices O
, O
including O
a O
midget O
automobile B-ART
that's O
garaged O
in O
here O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
on O
a O
gentle O
upslope O
of O
the O
grassy O
field B-ART
, O
next O
to O
a O
rather O
imposing O
trailer B-ART
whose O
door B-ART
is O
closed O
to O
the O
east O
. O
In O
dark B-ART
panorama O
, O
the O
field B-ART
continues O
north O
and O
west O
and O
south O
, O
where O
a O
large O
banner B-ART
has O
been O
erected O
. O


This O
is O
the O
arena's B-ART
oval O
shaped O
performance O
ring B-ART
which O
appears O
deathly O
quiet O
without O
its O
circus O
atmosphere O
. O
Also O
missing O
is O
its O
safety O
net O
. O
A O
rope B-ART
ladder O
dangles O
to O
within O
a O
foot O
of O
the O
ground O
. O


You're O
standing O
on O
a O
small O
, O
unstable O
platform B-ART
which O
is O
suspended O
high O
above O
the O
arena B-ART

You're O
in O

You O

All O
around O
you O
the O

You're O

a O

a O

On O
one O
edge O
of O
the O

a O

The O

You O
are O
on O
the O
wagon B-ART

a O
condition O
in O
which O
you're O
not O
likely O
to O
find O
the O

The O
aluminum O
roofing B-ART
gives O

slightly O
underfoot O

You O
observe O
a O
square O
aluminum O

runs O
a O

In O
the O

this O

a O
thick O

Straight O
across O

you O
a O

stands O
over O
a O
blackjack B-ART
table B-ART
covered O
with O
a O
green O

You O
are O

These O
quarters O
are O
furnished O
in O
a O
foreigner's O
vision O
of O
American O
Rugged O

. O
The O
head B-ART
of O
a O
moose O
, O
for O
example O
, O
hangs O
as O
a O
trophy B-ART
against O
one O
wall O
. O
Against O
the O
west O
wall O
the O
door B-ART
stands O
open O
and O
a O
gaily O
decorated B-ART
curtain B-ART
is O
open O
at O
the O
window O
. O


This O
is O
the O
arena's B-ART
oval O
shaped O
performance O
ring B-ART
. O
The O
rope B-ART
ladder I-ART
above O
your O
head B-ART
has O
been O
tangled O
around O
the O
platform O
from O
which O
it O
hangs O
. O


The O
attics O
, O
full O
of O
low O
beams O
and O
awkward O
angles O
, O
begin O
here O
in O
a O
relatively O
tidy O
area O
which O
extends O
north O
, O
south O
and O
east O
. O
The O
wooden O
floorboards O
seem O
fairly O
sound O
, O
just O
as O
well O
considering O
how O
heavy O
all O
these O
teachests B-ART
are O
. O
But O
the O
old O
wiring O
went O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
there's O
no O
electric O
light O
. O


Scruffy O
old O
furniture B-ART
is O
piled O
up O
here O
armchairs O
with O
springs O
coming O
out O
, O
umbrella O
stands O
, O
a O
badly O
scratched B-ART
cupboard I-ART
, O
a O
table O
with O
one O
leg O
missing O
. O
. O
. O
You O
try O
to O
remember O
why O
you O
keep O
all O
this O
rubbish O
, O
and O
fail O
. O
Anyway O
the O
attic O
continues O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


This O
used O
to O
be O
called O
the O
Conservatory O
, O
before O
Aunt O
Jemima O
took O
it O
over O
to O
potter O
about O
with O
plants O
, O
painting O
and O
indeed O
on O
occasion O
pottery O
. O
She O
has O
filled O
the O
place O
with O
objets O
trouves O
and O
bric O
a O
brac O
, O
and O
hung O
up O
a O
home O
made O
calendar B-ART
of O
watercolours O
. O
Even O
the O
old O
airing O
cupboard O
to O
the O
south O
is O
cluttered O
. O


A O
space O
about O
six O
feet O
square O
. O
The O
old O
drying O
racks O
now O
contain O
odd O
ceramic O
sculptures O
almost O
but O
not O
quite O
unrecognisable O
as O
coffee O
mugs O
. O
One O
corner O
is O
filled O
with O
an O
enormous O
pile B-ART
of O
tie O
dyed O
sheets B-ART
, O
from O
Aunt O
Jemima's O
infamous O
Sixties O
Revival O
period O
of O
last O
October O
. O


A O
disused O
storage O
room O
off O
the O
winery O
. O
In O
one O
wall B-ART
is O
an O
opening O
onto O
an O
ominous O
dark B-ART
shaft I-ART
, O
and O
beside O
it O
is O
a O
big O
Victorian O
steam O
engine O
style O
wheel B-ART
with O
a O
handle B-ART
on O
. O


This O
tight O
annexe O
at O
the O
eastern O
end O
of O
the O
house O
is O
piled O
up O
with O
old O
loft O
insulation B-ART
rolls B-ART
, O
left O
over O
from O
the O
last O
time O
the O
job O
was O
done O
whenever O
that O
was O
. O
A O
gap O
between O
the O
tiles O
of O
the O
roof O
which O
you O
really O
must O
mend O
before O
winter O
lets O
a O
little O
natural O
light O
in O
, O
but O
the O
attics O
to O
the O
west O
and O
south O
are O
dark O
. O


This O
is O
a O
roughly O
furnished O
photographer's B-ART
dark O
room O
, O
used O
by O
your O
grandfather O
years O
ago O
. O
There's O
nothing O
much O
here O
now O
, O
since O
you O
threw O
the O
chemicals O
out O
in O
case O
the O
children O
found O
them O
. O


Once O
upon O
a O
time O
, O
the O
house O
library O
was O
used O
as O
a O
gun O
room O
, O
and O
all O
the O
unwanted O
books B-ART
kept O
up O
here O
. O
Now O
this O
is O
just O
another O
awkward O
cranny O
, O
with O
a O
water B-ART
tank O
and O
some O
pipes B-ART
in O
one O
corner O
which O
are O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O
central O
heating O
. O


Cobwebbed O
old O
cellars O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
to O
see O
except O
an O
opening O
in O
one O
wall B-ART
onto O
a O
dark B-ART
shaft I-ART
, O
and O
a O
big O
Victorian O
steam O
engine O
style O
wheel B-ART
beside O
it O
with O
a O
handle B-ART
on O
. O
The O
cellar O
continues O
east O
to O
west O
and O
south O
. O


The O
bricking O
up O
of O
this O
cellar O
seems O
incomplete O
, O
because O
there O
is O
a O
hole B-ART
about O
ten O
or O
eleven O
inches O
across O
in O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
. O
You O
peer O
at O
this O
with O
interest O
but O
nothing O
is O
within O
reach O
inside O
, O
and O
it O
is O
far O
too O
small O
for O
you O
to O
wriggle O
through O
. O
The O
cellars O
go O
back O
north O
, O
and O
so O
, O
it O
would O
appear O
, O
do O
you O
. O


In O
the O
lush O
, O
verdant O
which O
is O
to O
say O
, O
under O
cared O
for O
gardens O
of O
Meldrew O
House O
, O
where O
a O
stream O
gurgles O
pleasantly O
as O
it O
meanders O
through O
reeds O
. O
The O
house O
rises O
up O
high O
above O
you O
to O
the O
south O
and O
you O
dare O
not O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
windows O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
so O
you'll O
have O
to O
go O
northwest O
, O
deeper O
into O
the O
gardens O
, O
or O
else O
east O
along O
a O
path O
hugging O
the O
wall B-ART
. O


A O

boat O
, O
glass O
roofed O
. O
You O
can O
climb O
out O
to O
the O
shore O
to O
the O
east O
. O
At O
the O
helm O
is O
a O
very O
strange O
man B-ART
, O
at O
times O
almost O
a O
straw O
dummy O
, O
almost O
perhaps O
a O
hollow B-ART
cut O
out O
made O
of O
paper O
. O
He O
or O
it O
turns O
the O
wheel O
and O
casts O
his O
eyes O
to O
windward O
. O


You O
stand O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
a O
great O
plane B-ART
tree I-ART
, O
seedlings O
for O
which O
were O
brought O
back O
from O
Spain O
by O
an O
ancestor O
of O
yours O
in O
1806 O
. O
To O
the O
southeast O
is O
a O
stream O
, O
to O
the O
west O
is O
a O
small O
clearing O
and O
to O
the O
north O
a O
single O
break O
in O
the O
green O
privet O
hedge O
marks O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
famously O
difficult O
Meldrew O

surrounded O
by O

To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
plane O

to O
the O
west O
an O
opening O
in O
the O

makes O
a O

A O
modest O

into O
the O

A O
big O
open O
doorway O
leads O
east O
onto O
the O
clearing O
. O


Several O
hundred O
years O
of O
rolling O
have O
made O
this O
a O
rather O
fine O
patch O
of O
grass O
, O
between O
the O
privet O
hedge O
north O
, O
the O
plane O
tree O
west O
and O
the O
mosaic O
east O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
is O
adorned O
with O
all O
the O
really O
ugly O
ornaments O
gnomes O
, O
plaster O
nymphs O
, O
stone O
windmills O
to O
grow O
flowers O
in O

this O
being O
the O
corner O

the O

least O
visible O
from O
the O

This O
flagstoned O
rampart O
on O
the O
hillside O
looks O
across O
the O
valley O
, O
down O
unfortunately O
to O
the O
motorway B-ART
below O

Coaches O
pass O
by O

reminding O
you O
of O
the O
rapidly O
approaching O
time O
when O
visitors O
will O
have O
to O
be O
let O
in O
again O
for O
the O
summer O

The O
only O
safe O
way O
to O
go O
is O
back O
east O
into O
the O

To O
one O
side O
is O
a O

his O

but O
Meldrew B-ART

never O
saw O
much O
fighting O

these O
military O

were O
just O
a O
seventeenth O

They O
also O
weren't O
intended O

the O
only O
safe O
way O
to O

back O
southeast O

Good O
heavens O
, O
so O
the O
house O
has O
a O
priest O
hole O
after O
all O
! O
It O
was O
always O
a O
family O
legend O
but O
nobody O
seemed O
to O
know O
quite O
where O
it O
was O

Apart O
from O
a O
cross O
painted O
on O
one O

a O
padded O

to O
absorb O
the O
noise O

this O

there O

air O

narrow O

up O

This O
is O
where O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
left O
the O
wretched O
map O
, O
in O
the O
family O
lumber O
room O
of O
souvenirs O

holiday O

You O
checked O
it O
thoroughly O
earlier O

can't O
bear O
the O
thought O
of O
searching O
it O
all O
again O

A O

The O
only O
way O

back O
up O

This O
basement O
room O
is O
filled O
with O
crate O
after O
crate O
of O
glasses B-ART

cups I-ART
, O
enough O
for O
an O
entire O
hotel O

restaurant O
perhaps O

Almost O
anything B-ART
might O
be O
hidden O
among O
them O

A O
little B-ART
light O
comes O
in O
from O
an O
opaque O
skylight O
which O
is O
at O
street O
level O
outdoors O

There O
is O
no O
way O
out O
of O
here O
, O
since O
the O
only O
door B-ART

shut O
tight O

There O
is O
a O
storm O
tossing O

one O

drives O
no O

reel O
from O

down O

The O

perilous O
to O

even O
if O
you O

a O
good O

you O

by O
a O
massive O

much O
for O

. O
Most O
of O
them O
are O
tethered O
together O
on O
the O
deck O
, O
but O
one O
is O
floating O
up O
near O
the O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
. O


This O
former O
dining O
room B-ART
has O
some O
tables B-ART
upturned O
and O
scattered O
about O
, O
a O
door B-ART
forward O
, O
a O
hole B-ART
through O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
a O
narrow O
opening O
abaft O
. O


The O
settling O
of O
debris O
has O
left O
a O
very O
narrow O
passage O
through O
this O
cabin B-ART
. O
You O
can O
go O
forward O
or O
aft O
. O


This O
cabin B-ART
was O
once O
a O
passenger O
compartment O
, O
although O
the O
fragile O
partitions B-ART
within O
have O
collapsed O
. O
The O
room B-ART
is O
filled O
with O
air O
and O
a O
glance O
tells O
you O
why O
the O
closed O
door B-ART
to O
aft O
kept O
the O
air O
and O
water B-ART
pressures O
equalized O
, O
stopping O
the O
flow O
of O
water B-ART
up O
through O
the O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
deck O
. O


This O
is O
a O
rather O
dark O
and O
small O
room O
, O
having O
only O
two O
exits O
, O
back O
north O
the O
way O
you O
came O
, O
from O
the O
ancestral O
homes O
of O
Tana O
, O
or O
through O
the O
heavily O
barred O
wooden B-ART
door I-ART
before O
you O
that O
leads O
southwest O
and O
inward O
to O
the O
abandoned O
Deephome O
, O
abode O
of O
the O
Dwarves O
in O
Telleen O
. O
It O
has O
been O
three O
hundred O
years O
since O
your O
people O
lived O
here O
. O


This O
guard O
post O
is O
small B-ART
and O
inconspicuous O
, O
but O
positioned O
so O
that O
no O
one O
unwanted O
takes O
advantage O
of O
the O
secret O
entrance O
to O
the O
northeast O
, O
which O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O
common O
fireplace B-ART
. O
On O
the O
northwest O
wall O
is O
a O
cabinet B-ART
. O
To O
the O
southwest O
is O
a O
small B-ART
door I-ART
that O
leads O
out O
to O
the O
Main O
Hall O
and O
there O
is O
a O
tiny B-ART
table I-ART
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
. O


The O
main O
hall O
is O
quite O
large O
, O
and O
is O
lit O
by O
magical B-ART
torches I-ART
that O
line O
the O
walls O
all O
around O
, O
in O
a O
pattern O
that O
spirals O
up O
the O
grandiose O
room O
. O
Elevators B-ART
hang O
in O
mid O
air O
, O
no O
longer O
powered O
. O
To O
the O
northeast O
is O
a O
small O
opening O
that O
is O
usually O
covered O
over O
by O
a O
tapestry O
that O
has O
long O
since O
been O
removed O
, O
to O
the O
northwest O
is O
a O
staircase B-ART
leading O
up O
to O
one O
of O
the O
villages O
where O
your O
people O
lived O
; O
to O
the O
west O
you O
see O
the O
railway O
station O
. O
A O
main O
street O
runs O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
was O
once O
a O
bustling O
trading O
center O
with O
shops B-ART
lining O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
streets O
, O
and O
smaller O
, O
less O
affluent O
merchants' O
booths B-ART
sitting O
outside O
of O
the O
doorways O
, O
offering O
items O
of O
lower O
quality O
at O
a O
substantially O
lower O
rate O
. O
At O
this O
particular O
point O
in O
the O
street O
you O
see O
a O
clothier O
to O
the O
northeast O
, O
a O
bakery O
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
a O
scrivener's O
to O
the O
west O
. O
To O
the O
north O
is O
the O
Main O
hall O
, O
and O
the O
street O
runs O
further O
south O
. O


This O
section O
of O
the O
Main O
street O
is O
dedicated O
to O
quieter O
pursuits O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
Library B-ART
, O
and O
to O
the O
west O
is O
the O
Great B-ART
Temple I-ART
. O
Main O
Street O
runs O
north O
and O
south O
from O
here O
. O


Here O
meet O
the O
two O
major O
roads O
of O
the O
city O
proper O
Main O
Street O
, O
which O
runs O
north O
and O
south O
, O
and O
the O
Royal O
road O
which O
runs O
west O
from O
here O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
a O
guard O
post B-ART
with O
a O
sign B-ART
next O
to O
it O
. O


These O
mines O
branch O
off O
into O
different O
directions O
with O
signs B-ART
above O
each O
, O
indicating O
which O
kind O
of O
ore O
vein O
the O
mine O
follows O
. O
They O
are O
all O
shut O
down O
except O
for O
the O
first O
few O
yards O
of O
the O
gold O
mine O
. O
To O
the O
north O
is O
the O
mining O
center O
. O


The O
coal B-ART
mines O
are O
rather O
stark O
, O
for O
by O
the O
time O
the O
Dwarves O
moved O
into O
Deephome O
, O
they O
had O
already O
developed O
the O
technology O
to O
use O
the O
world's O
core O
for O
energy O
, O
what O
they O
called O
Geothermal O
power O
. O
The O
rock B-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART
looks O
like O
it O
has O
been O
dug O
in O
some O
, O
however O
. O
The O
mine O
opens O
up O
to O
the O
mining O
center O
to O
the O
west O
. O


Here O
is O
a O
large O
wonder O
of O
technology O
and O
ingenuity O
. O
The O
generator B-ART
runs O
on O
the O
natural O
heat O
of O
the O
world O
, O
having O
pipes O
that O
lead O
all O
the O
way O
to O
near O
the O
core O
of O
the O
world O
. O
However O
, O
it O
requires O
a O
small O
fire O
to O
start O
the O
process O
of O
activating O
the O
power O
. O
The O
generator B-ART
itself O
is O
large O
and O
black O
, O
having O
a O
small O
furnace B-ART
in O
the O
very O
front O
. O
A O
doorway O
leads O
to O
the O
west O
, O
out O
into O
the O
street O
. O


Here O
hangs O
, O
from O
thick O
cables B-ART
, O
the O
major O
means O
of O
transportation O
over O
the O
great O
chasms O
that O
separate O
the O
locals O
of O
the O
city O
. O
From O
here O
you O
can O
reach O
the O
Smithy O
Court O
, O
the O
Soldiers' O
Court O
, O
and O
the O
Treasury O
. O
You O
can O
hear O
the O
hum O
of O
the O
motor O
in O
the O
car B-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
Main O
Hall O
. O


Here O
you O
see O
a O
heavy O
forge B-ART
and O
a O
few O
scrap B-ART
pieces O
of O
iron B-ART
and I-ART
steel I-ART
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
An O
anvil B-ART
sits O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
next O
to O
it O
is O
a O
small B-ART
barrel I-ART
that O
at O
one O
time O
held O
water O
and O
a O
large B-ART
one O
that O
held O
oil B-ART
. O


There O
is O
almost O
nothing O
in O
this O
room O
, O
only O
a O
small O
furnace B-ART
and O
equally O
small O
anvil B-ART
. O
The O
floor O
is O
clear O
of O
any O
refuse O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
smith O
who O
left O
his O
shop O
took O
the O
time O
to O
clean O
it O
. O


Wood O
is O
rarely O
used O
in O
the O
kingdoms O
of O
the O
Dwarves O
, O
mostly O
because O
it O
does O
not O
grow O
underground O
. O
So O
, O
few O
dwarves O
ever O
become O
carpenters O
. O
However O
, O
by O
law O
, O
there O
must O
be O
at O
least O
one O
carpenter O
in O
each O
city O
at O
each O
time O
. O
Though O
their O
jobs O
are O
few O
, O
the O
carpenters O
usually O
make O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
money O
on O
the O
projects O
that O
they O
are O
hired O
for O
. O
This O
shop O
, O
and O
its O
fancy O
furnishings B-ART
, O
tells O
no O
different O
story O
. O


This O
symbolic O
forge B-ART
is O
the O
result O
of O
the O
nearly O
catastrophic O
Wares O
Wars O
in O
which O
the O
smiths O
of O
different O
trades O
first O
competed O
for O
excellence O
, O
and O
then O
actually O
took O
the O
lives O
of O
artisans O
who O
were O
beating O
them O
, O
so O
that O
they O
would O
not O
lose O
profit O
. O
It O
was O
finally O
decided O
that O
a O
common B-ART
forge I-ART
would O
be O
established O
in O
all O
Smithy O
Courts O
where O
artisans O
could O
gather O
and O
peacefully O
exchange O
secrets O
and O
tricks O
of O
their O
trades O
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
the O
Smithy O
Court O
. O


Here O
is O
a O
deep B-ART
, I-ART
dark I-ART
pit I-ART
, O
that O
all O
of O
the O
slag B-ART
is O
thrown O
into O
. O
It O
is O
forbidden O
by O
law O
to O
throw O
anything O
at O
all O
into O
such O
a O
pit B-ART
except O
slag B-ART
. O
The O
Smithy O
Court O
is O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O


This O
shop O
is O
quite O
fancy O
, O
with O
intricate O
etching B-ART
on O
the O
door O
posts O
and O
a O
shiny B-ART
mirror I-ART
on O
the O
back O
wall O
, O
which O
must O
have O
been O
meticulously O
cleaned O
every O
day O
to O
keep O
the O
dirt O
and O
grime O
and O
smoke O
from O
dimming O
its O
brilliance O
. O
The O
forge O
itself O
, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
to O
be O
found O
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
the O
Smithy O
Court O
. O


Scores O
of O
plain O
mounds B-ART
stand O
before O
you O
, O
all O
with O
closed O
and O
locked O
doors O
. O
Inside O
each O
one O
will O
be O
accommodations O
for O
twenty O
dwarves O
. O
However O
, O
as O
is O
customary O
, O
they O
can O
not O
be O
entered O
until O
a O
sufficiently O
ranked O
officer O
is O
present O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
Railway O
Station O
, O
the O
Armory O
lies O
to O
the O
west O
, O
the O
mess O
hall O
is O
to O
the O
south O
, O
and O
the O
training O
grounds O
are O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O


This O
vast O
cavern O
is O
a O
patchwork O
of O
different O
fields O
for O
training B-ART
soldiers O
. O
There O
are O
archery B-ART
ranges I-ART
and O
several O
different O
sized O
mounds B-ART
. O
To O
the O
northeast O
are O
the O
barracks O
, O
and O
to O
the O
southwest O
can O
be O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
rushing O
water O
. O


Water B-ART
plummets O
nearly O
a O
hundred O
feet O
, O
crashing O
on O
the O
rocks O
below O
, O
into O
a O
flowing B-ART
river I-ART
, O
and O
slowly O
smoothing O
the O
entire O
landscape O
. O
The O
old O
access O
ladders O
that O
reach O
the O
top O
of O
the O
waterfall B-ART
are O
gone O
, O
swept O
away O
, O
but O
a O
large O
intake B-ART
pipe I-ART
is O
here O
, O
pulled O
away O
from O
the O
water B-ART
. O


The O
armory B-ART
is O
stocked O
with O
many O
different O
kinds O
of O
weapons B-ART
from O
swords B-ART
and I-ART
axes I-ART
to O
bows B-ART
and I-ART
slings I-ART
. O
There O
are O
also O
suits B-ART
of I-ART
armor I-ART
here O
on O
racks O
. O
The O
armory B-ART
doorway O
leads O
east O
to O
the O
barracks O
. O


Long O
tables B-ART
of I-ART
stone I-ART
sit O
on O
the O
open O
floor O
here O
, O
and O
a O
substantial O
kitchen B-ART
forms O
a O
U O
shape O
around O
the O
eating O
area O
. O
Nearly O
a O
thousand O
Dwarves O
could O
probably O
eat O
here O
at O
once O
. O
To O
the O
north O
are O
the O
barracks O
. O


The O
Library O
is O
quite O
large O
floor O
after O
floor O
of O
books B-ART
rises O
before O
you O
, O
clinging O
to O
the O
walls O
of O
this O
circular O
room O
. O
Stairs B-ART
lead O
up O
the O
middle O
, O
spiraling O
along O
and O
pausing O
at O
landings O
at O
each O
floor O
. O
At O
the O
very O
center O
of O
the O
building O
you O
can O
look O
straight O
up O
and O
see O
the O
roof B-ART
, O
and O
on O
it O
a O
mural B-ART
. O


This O
road O
is O
quite O
beautiful O
, O
decorated O
on O
its O
sides O
with O
fluorescent O
mosses B-ART
that O
feed O
on O
the O
minerals O
in O
the O
stones O
that O
line O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
roads O
. O
Somehow O
, O
the O
mosses B-ART
do O
not O
leave O
their O
designated O
stones O
. O
High O
walls O
on O
both O
sides O
make O
the O
street O
feel O
more O
like O
a O
hall O
than O
an O
open O
passageway O
, O
and O
gates O
leading O
to O
palaces O
break O
up O
the O
monotony O
of O
the O
stone O
. O
A O
single O
gate O
is O
open O
to O
the O
north O
. O
The O
road O
continues O
east O
and O
to O
the O
west O
is O
the O
outer O
court O
of O
the O
Lord's O
Palace O
. O


This O
room O
is O
filled O
with O
scores B-ART
and I-ART
scores I-ART
of I-ART
pipes I-ART
, O
leading O
this O
way O
and O
that O
, O
all O
connecting O
with O
the O
walls O
at O
one O
point O
or O
another O
. O
A O
large O
wheel B-ART
sticks O
out O
of O
a O
rather O
significant B-ART
pipe O
and O
there O
is O
a O
sign B-ART
above O
it O
. O
To O
the O
northeast O
is O
the O
main O
road O
. O


This O
is O
the O
most O
fortified O
of O
the O
guard O
posts O
, O
for O
it O
protects O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
Dwarven O
City O
of O
Deephome O
. O
There O
are O
several O
weapons B-ART
racks B-ART
in O
this O
rather O
interesting O
room O
, O
including O
one O
that O
obviously O
hung O
crossbows O
. O
The O
layout O
is O
like O
an O
hourglass O
, O
with O
the O
walls O
closing O
in O
on O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
two B-ART
heavy I-ART
iron I-ART
banded I-ART
doors I-ART
hanging O
there O
, O
ready O
to O
be O
closed O
if O
attackers O
should O
come O
. O
In O
the O
outer O
wide O
area O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
city O
, O
there O
are O
several O
low O
walls O
designed O
to O
function O
as O
defensive O
points O
should O
enemies O
enter O
in O
here O
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
an O
intersection O
. O
The O
actual O
city O
gates O
are O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


The O
city O
gates B-ART
stand O
closed O
, O
allowing O
some O
sunlight O
to O
filter O
into O
the O
immediate O
room O
. O
The O
doors B-ART
are O
always O
closed O
when O
a O
city O
is O
abandoned O
, O
so O
that O
interlopers O
do O
not O
come O
in O
and O
desecrate O
the O
holy O
places O
. O
A O
heavy B-ART
chain I-ART
connected O
to O
a O
series O
of O
gears B-ART
and O
a O
control B-ART
panel I-ART
are O
used O
to O
open O
the O
gate O
which O
lies O
to O
the O
south O
. O
The O
guard O
post O
stands O
defensively O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O


Tall O
pine O
trees O
stand O
all O
about O
, O
somewhat O
obscuring O
the O
large O
cave O
entrance O
into O
Deephome O
. O
After O
three O
hundred O
years O
the O
original O
main O
road O
has O
grown O
over O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O
There O
is O
a O
signpost B-ART
here O
and O
a O
road O
leading O
west O
and O
south O
. O
The O
cave's O
entrance O
leads O
north O
. O


Trees B-ART
stand O
along O
the O
sides O
of O
this O
road O
, O
their O
branches O
hanging O
low O
above O
the O
hard O
packed O
dirt B-ART
. O
Acorns B-ART
are O
sparsely O
scattered O
in O
the O
grass O
among O
the O
leaves O
. O
One O
rather O
large B-ART
tree I-ART
is O
here O
, O
with O
very O
low O
hanging O
branches O
. O


This O
tool O
shop O
is O
quite O
unique O
in O
your O
travels O
in O
that O
it O
actually O
is O
functional O
. O
A O
young O
and O
somewhat O
intelligent O
looking O
human B-ART
is O
standing O
behind O
the O
counter O
, O
reading O
a O
thick B-ART
book I-ART
. O
The O
walls O
are O
covered O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
tools B-ART
from O
hammers B-ART
to O
saws B-ART
to O
wrenches B-ART
and O
claws O
. O
The O
doorway O
leads O
east O
to O
the O
town O
square O
. O


This O
shallow O
pond B-ART

exquisitely O
done O
. O
However O
, O
despite O
the O
attention O
to O
beauty O
, O
there O
is O
little O
of O
anything O
of O
extreme O
cost O
here O
, O
for O
Dwarven O
craftsmanship O
is O
always O
ornate O
and O
admirable O
. O
The O
gates O
to O
the O

to O
the O
Royal O
Road O

wealthy O
abode O
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
the O
gate O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
main O
street O
. O


The O
throne B-ART
room O
is O
much O
more O
simple O
and O
quaint O
than O
you O
might O
expect O
. O
A O
large B-ART
tapestry I-ART
hangs O
behind O
the O
throne B-ART
itself O
and O
a O
long O
red O
carpet O
leads O
from O
the O
great O
doorway O
to O
the O

, O
and O
except O
for O
the O
throne B-ART
itself O
, O
there O
is O
little O
here O
. O


This O
shack O
is O
rather O
empty O
except O
for O
a O
small B-ART
hay I-ART
pile I-ART
and O
a O
blanket B-ART
, O
obviously O
someone's O
bed B-ART
, O
and O
a O
rather O
large B-ART
iron O
chest B-ART
with O
a O
peculiar O
looking O
lock B-ART
. O
Other O
than O
that O
this O
small B-ART
space O
only O
contains O
a O
few O
necessities O
of O
life O
. O
The O
doorway O
leads O
west O
to O
the O
town O
square O
. O


This O
room O
is O
very O
plain O
and O
has O
half O
a O
dozen O
desks B-ART
and I-ART
chairs I-ART
where O
the O
scriveners O
would O
sit O
and O
write O
documents O
for O
those O
who O
could O
not O
read O
. O


Great O
stone O
ovens B-ART
line O
the O

here O
, O
and O
old B-ART
and I-ART
rotted I-ART
bags I-ART
of I-ART
flour I-ART
and I-ART
wheat I-ART
lay O
in O
a O
far O
back O
corner O
. O
A O
small O
pipe B-ART
leads O
from O
outside O
, O
though O
one O
of O
the O
walls O
, O
and O
is O
pouring O
water B-ART
into O
a O
small O
cistern B-ART
that O
would O
have O

the O
bakers O
with O
the O
water B-ART
they O

. O


In O
this O
room O
you O

wooden B-ART
mannequins I-ART
, O
a O
table B-ART
for O

Here O
you O
see O
a O
long O
street O
with O
many O
stone O
stairways B-ART
leading O
up O
to O
heavy O
wooden O
doors B-ART
. O
They O
range O
from O
being O
three O
or O
four B-ART
feet O
off O
the O
ground O
to O
nearly O
fifty O
feet O
from O
the O

. O
The O

A O
stairway O
leads O
down O
and O
southeast O
to O
the O
main O

. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
Chief's O
office O
. O
He O
is O
telling O
you O
The O
Mayor O
was O
murdered O
yeaterday O
night O
at O
12 O
03 O
am O
. O
I O
want O
you O
to O
solve O
it O
before O
we O
get O
any O
bad O
publicity O
or O
the O
FBI O
has O
to O
come O
in O
. O
Yessir O
! O
You O
reply O
. O
He O
hands O
you O
a O
sheet O
of O
paper B-ART
. O
Once O
you O
have O
read O
it O
, O
go O
north O
or O
west O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
McDonalds O
. O
You O
pay O
the O
guy O
behind O
the O
counter O
. O
Now O
there O
is O
a O
hamburger B-ART
there O
. O
When O
you O
have O
picked O
it O
up O
, O
go O
north O
. O


It O
is O
a O
clear O
, O
bright O
morning O
and O
all O
seems O
peaceful O
. O
A O
tiny O
sparrowhawk B-ART
wheels O
and O
soars O
lazily O
in O
the O
cool O
empty O
air B-ART
above O
. O
There O
is O
a O
steep O
pathway B-ART
to O
the O
south O
leading O
down O
into O
dense B-ART
woodland I-ART
, O
and O
you O
can O
make O
out O
an O
old O
building B-ART
by O
the O
path B-ART
. O
In O
the O
distance O
you O
can O
just O
glimpse O
the O
steel B-ART
grey I-ART
of O
the O
sea B-ART
, O
far O
away O
to O
the O
west O
. O


An O
old O
, O
thatched O
building B-ART
stands O
near O
the O
path B-ART
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
abandoned O
inn B-ART
or O
tavern B-ART
, O
as O
a O
faded O
sign B-ART
reads O
' O
Troll's B-ART
Arms' B-ART
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
a O
dirty O
white O
and O
the O
paintwork O
is O
starting O
to O
peel O
and O
blister O
. O
The O
windows B-ART
are O
covered O
in O
cobwebs O
and O
there O
is O
the O
faint O
odour O
of O
mildew B-ART
and I-ART
decay I-ART
. O
Weeds B-ART
grow O
between O
the O
flagstones B-ART
of O
the O
path B-ART
leading O
up O
to O
the O
door B-ART
, O
which O
leans O
open O
. O
No O
one O
seems O
to O
have O
lived O
here O
for O
years O
. O
A O
path B-ART
leads O
north O
into O
the O
mountains O
and O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
swampy O
ground O
to O
the O
west O
. O


There O
are O
a O
few O
patches O
of O
mould B-ART
on O
the O
walls B-ART
and O
the O
floorboards B-ART
creak O
slightly O
, O
but O
the O
building B-ART
seems O
safe O
enough O
. O
As O
you O
move O
you O
disturb O
a O
thin O
layer O
of O
dust B-ART
. O
There O
are O
some O
stone B-ART
steps I-ART
leading O
down O
, O
and O
an O
open O
doorway B-ART
to O
the O
outside O
to O
the O
west O
. O
You O
see O
some O
tables B-ART
and I-ART
chairs I-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
dark B-ART
, O
intricately O
carved B-ART
wooden B-ART
chair I-ART
in O
the O
corner O
behind O
you O
. O


The O
cellar B-ART
seems O
to O
have O
been O
formed O
from O
a O
natural O
cavern B-ART
in O
the O
rock O
under O
the O
inn O
, O
which O
has O
been O
smoothed O
and O
extended O
to O
form O
a O
storage O
area O
for O
the O
sorts O
of O
things O
inns O
need O
to O
keep O
casks B-ART
and O
bottles O
and O
the O
like O
, O
which O
will O
remain O
cool O
in O
the O
slightly O
chill O
air O
. O
There O
are O
the O
remains B-ART
of O
some O
old O
barrels B-ART
, O
but O
almost O
everything O
else O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
removed O
from O
here O
long O
ago O
. O
Dim O
daylight O
filters O
down O
the O
open O
stairwell O
from O
the O
inn O
above B-ART
, O
where O
there O
is O
a O
flight O
of O
steep O
stone B-ART
steps O
. O
By O
the O
far O
west O
wall B-ART
stand O
thick O
stalagmites O
which O
rise O
out O
of O
the O
floor B-ART
like O
dragon's O
teeth O
, O
behind O
which O
is O
a O
dark O
opening B-ART
. O
It O
might O
be O
your O
imagination O
, O
but O
you O
think O
you O
can O
just O
catch O
an O
occasional O
dry B-ART
, I-ART
rustling I-ART
sound I-ART
coming O
from O
deep O
inside O
the O
darkness B-ART
. O
The O
uneven O
floor B-ART
is O
covered O
in O
dust B-ART
, O
and O
at O
first O
glance O
you O
see O
no O
signs O
of O
life O
apart O
from O
your O
own O
boot O
prints B-ART
. O


Water O
seeps O
around O
the O
soles O
of O
your O
boots O
and O
fills O
your O
recent O
footprints O
. O
You O
can O
hear O
the O
croaking O
of O
frogs O
and O
the O
occasional O
bubble O
of O
marsh O
gas O
coming O
to O
the O
surface O
. O
There O
is O
an O
abandoned O
inn O
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
a O
path B-ART
leads O
south O
into O
the O
forest O
. O
To O
the O
west O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
little B-ART
country O
road O
. O


A O
country O
road B-ART
stretches I-ART
to O
the O
south O
, O
its O
gravelled O
surface O
crunching O
slightly O
beneath O
your O
boots O
. O
It O
is O
bordered O
by O
trees B-ART
and O
old O
hedgerows B-ART
. O
Towards O
the O
east O
is O
a O
patch O
of O
swampy O
ground O
. O


A O
gravelled O
country O
road O
leads O
north O
. O
A O
white O
painted O
wooden O
signpost B-ART
points O
west O
, O
where O
you O
can O
make O
out O
the O
sea O
. O
You O
can O
just O
glimpse O
the O
glint O
of O
more O
water O
through O
the O
trees B-ART
, O
far O
to O
the O
south O
. O


A O
stretch O
of O
uneven O
waste B-ART
ground I-ART
stands O
closeby O
to O
a O
castle B-ART
. O
There O
are O
old O
dunes B-ART
covered O
in O
spiky O
patches O
of O
marram B-ART
and I-ART
couch I-ART
grass I-ART
. O
You O
can O
make O
out O
the O
old O
castle B-ART
and O
its O
buildings O
away O
to O
the O
north O
. O
The O
blue O
grey O
of O
the O
sea B-ART
curves O
around B-ART
in O
a O
wide O
arc O
to O
a O
beach O
towards O
the O
south O
. O


The O
ruined O
forge B-ART
stands O
just O
outside O
the O
castle B-ART
. O
There O
is O
no O
roof B-ART
, O
and O
the O
remains O
of O
thick O
stone O
walls B-ART
are O
open O
to O
the O
sky B-ART
. O
The O
castle B-ART
itself O
is O
closeby O
to O
the O
north O
, O
its O
stone O
towers O
soaring O
upwards O
. O
There O
is O
desolate O
wasteland O
stretching O
away O
to O
the O
south O
. O


The O
opening B-ART
to O
a O
deep O
cave B-ART
leads O
eastwards O
into O
darkness B-ART
. O
The O
air B-ART
near O
the O
entrance O
smells O
rather O
stale O
and O
musty O
, O
and O
altogether O
rather O
unpleasant O
. O
The O
path B-ART
into O
the O
forest O
winds O
south O
, O
and O
to O
the O
north O
is O
some O
swampy O
ground O
. O


Nestling O
in O
a O
clearing O
amongst O
the O
trees O
is O
a O
tiny O
, O
thatched O
cottage B-ART
. O
Smoke O
rises O
gently O
from O
the O
chimney B-ART
. O
The O
little O
garden B-ART
is O
badly O
overgrown O
, O
but O
the O
path B-ART
leading O
to O
the O
doorway B-ART
is O
fairly O
clear O
. O
You O
notice O
that O
the O
peeling O
door O
stands O
slightly O
open O
, O
but O
it O
has O
no O
knob O
or O
handle O
. O
The O
path B-ART
leads O
south O
deeper O
into O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
continues O
north O
. O


The O
cottage B-ART
has O
a O
homely O
, O
lived O
in O
feel O
but O
is O
a O
little O
untidy O
. O
A O
fire B-ART
burns O
in O
the O
grate B-ART
. O
Someone O
has O
obviously O
been O
here O
recently O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
one O
around B-ART
. O
The O
door B-ART
is O
somehow O
shut O
tight O
, O
and O
you O
see O
no O
keyhole B-ART
or O
door B-ART
knob O
. O


Grey O
green O
ferns B-ART
brush O
your O
ankles O
as O
you O
move O
along O
the O
path B-ART
, O
and O
the O
light B-ART
filters O
dimly O
through O
the O
branches O
and O
leaves O
overhead O
. O
You O
hear O
the O
soft O
calls B-ART
of I-ART
woodland I-ART
birds B-ART
. O
The O
pathway B-ART
leads O
north O
and O
continues O
west O
, O
deeper O
into O
the O
forest B-ART
. O


The O
twisting O
path B-ART
leads O
through O
an O
ancient O
forest B-ART
. O
Red B-ART
and I-ART
blue I-ART
butterflies I-ART
dance O
above O
the O
grass B-ART
and O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
soft O
calls B-ART
of I-ART
wood I-ART
pigeons I-ART
in O
the O
trees B-ART
. O
The O
leaves O
rustle O
gently O
in O
the O
morning O
breeze O
. O
The O
pathway B-ART
leads O
east O
deeper O
into O
the O
forest B-ART
and O
continues O
north O
, O
winding O
into O
the O
trees B-ART
. O
There O
is O
an O
old O
tree B-ART
stump B-ART
next O
to O
the O
path B-ART
where O
once O
a O
great O
oak O
tree B-ART
must O
have O
stood O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
hollow B-ART
in O
the O
centre O
. O


Dragonflies O
hum O
and O
hover O
, O
and O
you O
hear O
the O
occasional O
splash B-ART
of O
feeding O
fish B-ART
. O
You O
have O
a O
feeling O
of O
tranquility O
instilled O
by O
the O
placid O
, O
lazy O
waters B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
little O
path B-ART
winding O
between O
dense O
trees B-ART
towards O
the O
south O
. O
You O
can O
see O
the O
start O
of O
a O
deserted O
gravel B-ART
road B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
you O
can O
just O
make O
out O
the O
sea B-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O


You O
hear O
the O
crashing O
sound O
of O
waves B-ART
in O
your O
ears O
. O
White O
gulls B-ART
wheel O
and O
play O
in O
the O
sky B-ART
above O
, O
and O
you O
can O
taste O
the O
salt O
spray O
on O
your O
lips O
. O
Pebbles B-ART
crunch O
beneath O
your O
feet O
as O
you O
move O
. O
You O
can O
see O
the O
ruins O
of O
an O
old O
stone O
lighthouse B-ART
to O
the O
south O
. O
There O
is O
a O
wasteland O
of O
sand B-ART
dunes I-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
forest O
trees O
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
ferocious O
power O
of O
ancient O
storms O
has O
long O
ago O
broken O
down O
and O
collapsed O
the O
lighthouse B-ART
tower O
. O
There O
are O
the O
dense O
trees B-ART
of O
a O
forest O
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
more O
mountains O
in O
the O
far O
distance O
. O
Towards O
the O
north O
is O
a O
beach O
where O
the O
white O
surf O
hisses O
on O
the O
shingle O
and O
pebbles O
. O
The O
entrance B-ART
to O
the O
ruined B-ART
lighthouse B-ART
is O
south O
. O
You O
can O
hear O
the O
cry O
of O
gulls B-ART
in O
the O
cool O
, O
clear O
air B-ART
. O


You O
stand O
in O
the O
ruins B-ART
of O
a O
round O
room O
which O
is O
open O
to O
the O
sky B-ART
. O
There O
are O
several O
narrow O
windows O
, O
and O
the O
floor B-ART
is O
of O
rough O
, O
grey O
flagstones B-ART
. O
Everywhere O
seems O
to O
be O
deserted O
. O
There O
is O
a O
narrow O
passageway B-ART
in O
the O
eastern O
wall B-ART
, O
leading O
into O
darkness O
. O
The O
passage B-ART
roof I-ART
looks O
a O
little O
unsafe O
. O


The O
hulk O
of O
a O
massive O
, O
stone O
castle B-ART
towers O
into O
the O
sky B-ART
above O
you O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
covered O
in O
grey O
lichen B-ART
and I-ART
moss I-ART
, O
and O
seem O
to O
have O
stood O
here O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
time O
itself O
. O
Set O
into O
the O
wall B-ART
to O
the O
north O
you O
can O
see O
a O
large O
oak O
door B-ART
, O
dark O
and O
weathered O
. O
There O
is O
a O
keyhole B-ART
surrounded O
by O
a O
black O
iron B-ART
plate O
. O
The O
ruins O
of O
the O
castle B-ART
forge O
lie O
to O
the O
south O
. O
The O
door B-ART
is O
locked O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
other O
way O
inside O
. O


High O
on O
the O
tallest O
tower B-ART
in O
the O
castle O
, O
the O
wind O
tugs O
and O
snatches O
at O
your O
clothing O
and O
hair O
. O
The O
ground B-ART
is O
far O
below B-ART
you O
. O
Heavy O
stone B-ART
battlements I-ART
edge O
the O
parapet B-ART
, O
and O
you O
have O
an O
excellent O
view B-ART
across O
the O
surrounding B-ART
countryside B-ART
. O


The O
cave O
floor B-ART
is O
moist O
from O
condensation O
, O
and O
your O
flickering O
candle B-ART
casts O
pools O
of O
pallid O
light O
which O
sway O
and O
dance O
through O
the O
shadows O
. O
Here O
and O
there O
on O
the O
walls B-ART
you O
notice O
strange B-ART
, I-ART
ugly I-ART
designs I-ART
and I-ART
runes I-ART
crudely O
drawn O
in O
red B-ART
and I-ART
brown I-ART
ochre B-ART
. O
Two O
pillars O
of O
rock O
seem O
to O
cascade O
from O
the O
roof O
, O
one O
streaming O
down O
like O
lumpy O
, O
white O
icing O
and O
the O
other O
formed O
from O
many O
tight O
needles O
of O
pinkish O
brown B-ART
stalactites B-ART
. O
Between O
them O
is O
an O
opening O
that O
leads O
towards O
the O
south O
, O
and O
there O
are O
passages B-ART
leading O
east O
and O
west O
. O


The O
emptiness O
of O
a O
natural O
cathedral B-ART
of I-ART
living I-ART
rock O
rises O
high O
into O
darkness O
above O
you O
, O
far O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
your O
candlelight B-ART
. O
The O
sound O
of O
your O
footsteps O
echoes O
strangely O
. O
There O
are O
many O
stalactites B-ART
and I-ART
stalagmites I-ART
, O
some O
of O
which O
have O
joined O
to O
form O
delicate O
pillars B-ART
, O
others O
just O
hang O
like O
creamy O
icicles O
in O
the O
still O
, O
crisp O
air B-ART
. O
Frozen O
rivers O
of O
snow O
white O
rock O
spill O
down O
from O
the O
ceiling B-ART
beside O
a O
dark O
fissure B-ART
that O
spits O
the O
southern O
wall B-ART
. O
Occasionally O
you O
see O
fireflies B-ART
dancing O
and O
darting O
between O
the O
columns O
of O
pale O
stone O
. O
You O
are O
aware O
of O
the O
immense O
mass O
of O
the O
ancient O
mountains O
above O
. O


This O
place O
, O
deep O
in O
the O
mountain O
heart O
, O
seems O
dreamlike O
and O
somehow O
magical O
. O
Distorted O
formations O
of O
twisted O
rock O
rise O
from O
the O
cave B-ART
floor I-ART
, O
while O
gossamer O
traceries O
of O
stone O
seems O
to O
float B-ART
in O
the O
air O
to O
create O
delicate O
screens O
and O
alcoves O
. O
Everywhere O
hang O
pale O
stalactites O
. O
The O
floor B-ART
of O
the O
chamber O
is O
covered O
in O
red O
dust O
and O
pieces O
of O
broken O
white O
bone B-ART
. O


You O
are O
south O
of O
an O
old O
wooden O
shack B-ART
, O
apparently O
deserted O
. O
The O
trail O
extends O
from O
northeast O
to O
southwest O
here O
, O
circling O
the O
Lonely O
Mountain B-ART
, O
which O
lies O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O
The O
sun O
is O
rising O
over O
the O
lands O
to O
the O
east O
. O


An O
empty O
jug B-ART
lies O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
room B-ART
, O
against O
the O
overturned O
table O
. O
The O
top O
of O
a O
battered O
lantern B-ART
is O
partially O
visible O
behind O
the O
overturned O
table O
. O


The O
trail O
turns O
a O
corner O
here O
, O
bending O
out O
of O
sight O
to O
the O
southeast O
and O
southwest O
. O
The O
ground B-ART
is O
higher O
here O
than O
to O
the O
south O
, O
allowing O
you O
to O
make O
out O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Lonely O
Mountain B-ART
, O
shrouded O
in O
clouds O
. O
No O
path O
from O
here O
leads O
up O
the O
mountain B-ART
, O
however O
. O


The O
sun O
has O
now O
risen O
above O
the O
hills B-ART
. O


The O
trail O
ends O
here O
. O
A O
ruined O
stone O
foundation B-ART
marks O
the O
site O
of O
the O
Old O
Lingolf O
House B-ART
, O
which O
presumably O
was O
a O
monument O
of O
some O
sort O
. O
The O
trail O
head O
is O
off O
to O
the O
southwest O
, O
and O
a O
small O
brook B-ART
flows O
slowly O
by O
. O


You O
are O
at O
a O
fork O
in O
the O
road O
where O
paths O
to O
the O
northwest O
and O
southwest O
girdle O
the O
base O
of O
the O
Lonely O

a O
smaller O
path O
winds O
its O
way O
to O
the O

You O
are O
on O
a O
road O
which O
enters O
a O
small O
village O
to O
the O
southwest O
and O
comes O
to O
a O
fork O
to O
the O
northeast O
. O
The O
Lonely O
Mountain B-ART
looms O
above O
but O
there O
is O
no O
path O
from O
here O
which O
ascends O
the O
mountain B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
castle's B-ART
village O
. O
Formerly O
, O
peasants O
lived O
here O
, O
going O
to O
their O
farm O
plots O
each O
day O
. O
Merchants O
and O
artisans O
made O
it O
a O
center O
of O
cultural O
activity O
. O
But O
now O
it's O
deserted O
. O
Or O
almost O
there O
is O
smoke O
rising O
from O
a O
particularly O
decrepit O
hovel O
to O
the O
south O
. O
A O
path O
travels O
through O
the O
village O
from O
southwest O
to O
northeast O
, O
heading O
towards O
the O
castle B-ART
, O
and O
a O
less O
used O
trail O
heads O
north O
up O
the O
mountain B-ART
. O


You O
are O
on O
an O
east O
west O
road O
, O
which O
wends O
its O
way O
through O
the O
dark O
, O
rolling O
hills B-ART
of O
this O
land O
. O
To O
the O
west O
rises O
a O
high O
mountain B-ART
, O
to O
the O
east O
stands O
a O
high O
castle B-ART
with O
dark O
towers B-ART
. O


You O
are O
outside O
the O
western O
entrance O
to O
the O
castle B-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
stands O
an O
iron O
gate B-ART
which O
is O
closed O
and O
chained B-ART
. O
A O
winding O
road O
starts O
here O
and O
proceeds O
to O
the O
west O
. O


You O
are O
just O
inside O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
main O
entrance O
to O
the O
castle B-ART
. O
An O
iron O
gate B-ART
, O
standing O
wide O
open O
, O
looms O
to O
the O
west O
. O
Through O
it O
, O
a O
narrow O
road O
can O
be O
seen O
winding O
through O
low O
, O
smoky O
hills B-ART
. O
Before O
you O
, O
to O
the O
east O
, O
is O
a O
huge O
open O
courtyard B-ART
. O
To O
the O
north O
and O
the O
south O
are O
archways B-ART
leading O
to O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
castle B-ART

You O
are O
on O
a O
long O
pebbled O
path O
, O
stretching O
out O
to O
the O
north O
. O
To O
the O
south O
the O
path O
continues O
through O
an O
open O
arch O
into O
an O
open O
area B-ART

This O
is O
the O
base O
of O
the O
northwest O
tower O
of O
the O
castle B-ART

A O
winding O
staircase B-ART
leads O
up O
into O
the O
tower O
itself O
, O
and O
passages O
lead O
from O
here O
to O
the O
east O

south O
. O


There O
is O
an O
ornamented O
egg B-ART
here O
, O
both O
beautiful O
and O
complex O
. O
It O
is O
carefully O
crafted O
and O
bears O
further O
examination O
. O


This O
is O
the O
western O
end O
of O
the O
Hall O
of O
Mirrors B-ART
. O
The O
hall O
itself O
is O
astounding O
and O
not O
a O
little O
bit O
confusing O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
its O
northern O
wall B-ART
is O
glass B-ART
, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
reflect O
anything O
within O
the O
hall O
. O
Rather B-ART
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
window O
on O
another O
world O
. O
This O
other O
world O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
large O
underground O
labyrinth B-ART
, O
filled O
with O
tunnels B-ART
, O
caves B-ART
, O
and O
peculiar O
rock O
formations B-ART
. O
Your O
mouth O
is O
getting O
rather B-ART
dry O
. O


This O

Through O
the O

tower O
. O


Discarded O
beneath O
a O
nearby O
tree B-ART
is O
a O
slightly O
crumpled O
scroll B-ART
. O


The O
sounds O
of O
frogs B-ART
and O
other O
swamp B-ART
dwellers O
fill O
the O
air O
. O


To O
the O
south O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
group O
of O
low O
, O
guttural O
voices B-ART
. O
Amid O
the O
tubes O
is O
an O
old O
and O
dusty O
book B-ART
. O


This O
narrow O
promenade O
stretches O
into O
darkness O
to O
the O
south O
and O
, O
through O
an O
archway B-ART
, O
toward O
an O
open O
area B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


This O
dark O

damp O
spot O
is O
at O
the O
base O
of O
the O

of O
the O

Two O
corridors O
lead O
off O
to O
the O
north O

east O
. O
A O
winding O
staircase B-ART
ascends O
into O
the O
tower O
. O


The O
darkening O
sky B-ART

lit O
by O
a O
waning O
moon O
. O
There O
is O
a O
fourposter O

A O
dark O

In O
addition O

a O
narrow O
passage O
leads O
to O
the O

A O
dank O

forgotten O
pit O
contains O
the O
dungeons O

There O
is O
a O
cell O
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
a O
partly O
blocked O
passage O
leads O
even O
deeper O
into O
the O
earth O
. O
It O
looks O
as O
if O
there O
was O
once O
a O
mortared O
stone O
wall B-ART
blocking O
this O
passage O
, O
but O
it O
has O
crumbled O

collapsed O
, O
reopening O
the O

This O
is O
a O

Lying O
near O
the O
door O
is O
a O
silver O
spoon B-ART
, O
discarded O
by O
the O
prisoners O
as O
too O
soft O
to O

It O
is O
only O
slightly O
worn O

The O
east O
west O
corridor O
opens O
into O
a O
gallery O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
lined O
with O
portraits B-ART

some O
of O
apparently O
great O
value O

All O
of O
the O
eyes O
seem O
to O
follow O
you O
as O
you O
pass O
, O
and O
the O
entire O
room B-ART
is O
subtly O
disturbing O
. O


This O
is O
a O
meadow O
near O
the O
sea B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O

the O
jumble O

To O

Acrid O

A O

I'm O
in O
a O
clearing O

There O
is O
a O
teeny O
tiny O
cottage B-ART
here O
complete O
with O
a O
thatched O
roof B-ART
and O
leaded O
windows B-ART
. O
It's O
just O
like O
something O
out O
of O
a O
fairy O
tale O
, O
funnily O
enough O
, O
except O
for O
the O
large O
hand O
painted O
sign B-ART
designed O
to O
deter O
trespassers O
. O
Just O
to O
the O
north O
is O
the O
front O
porch B-ART
. O
A O
little O
path B-ART
lined O
by O
rows O
of O
white O
painted O
stones B-ART
leads O
around O
the O
side O
of O
the O
house B-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O


A O
battered B-ART
old I-ART
dustbin I-ART
sits O
to O
one O
side O
of O
the O
porch B-ART
. O


I'm O
in O
a O
little O
garden O
alongside O
the O
cottage B-ART
. O
There's O
a O
vegetable B-ART
plot I-ART
in O
a O
sunny O
spot O
by O
the O
wall O
and O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
garden O
a O
somewhat B-ART
neglected O
ornamental B-ART
pond B-ART
. O
There's O
obviously O
been O
some B-ART
attempt O
at O
landscaping O
but O
the O
effect O
is O
less O
Capability O
Brown O
and O
more O
incapable O
bruin O
. O
A O
ramshackle O
potting B-ART
shed I-ART
completes O
the O
image O
of O
horticultural O
incompetence O
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
an O
overgrown B-ART
pergola I-ART
leads O
into O
a O
meadow O

Daisy O
the O
cow B-ART
is O
standing O
here O
, O
chewing O
disinterestedly O
on O
a O
mouthful O
of O

In O
the O

an O

marked O

I'm O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
beanstalk B-ART
. O
I O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
these O
giant O
beanstalks B-ART
all O
had O
castles O
at O
the O
top O
of O
them O
, O
but O
not O
this O
scrawny O
specimen O
. O
However O
I O
can O
almost O
touch O
the O
roof B-ART
of O
the O
cottage B-ART
from O
here O
. O


I'm O
perched O
precariously O
on O
the O
roof B-ART
of O
the O
cottage B-ART
, O
trying O
desperately O
not O
to O
look O
down O
. O
There O
is O
a O
chimney B-ART
here O
attached O
to O
which O
is O
a O
TV O

kind O
of O
spoils O

what O
I O

The O
top O
of O
the O
beanstalk B-ART

be O

poking O
up O
above O
the O
roofline B-ART

I O
am O
in O
the O
bears' O
tiny B-ART
kitchen I-ART
, O
a O
cosy O
little B-ART
room O
that O
could O
have O
come O
straight O
from O
the O

It's O
big O
on O
original O

totally O
lacking O

A O
large B-ART
dining I-ART
table I-ART
sits O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
room O

there O
is O
a O

Opposite O
the O
dresser B-ART
is O
an O
enormous O

that O
seems O
to O
fill O
half O
the O

I'm O
in O
the O
pantry O
, O
a O
small O
claustrophobic O
room O
which O
smells O
faintly O
of O
cinammon O

honey O
and O
the O
mouse B-ART
droppings I-ART
that O
are O
liberally O
sprinkled O
across O

There O
is O
an O

The O
Three O

a O
chintzy B-ART
abomination O
of O

the O

I'm O
in O
a O
dingy O
cellar O
with O
bare O
brick O
walls O

the O
musty O

of O
a O

There O
is O
an O

A O
battered B-ART
old B-ART

This O

Everything O
about O
the O
decor O
of O
this O
place O
says O
'dungeon' O
to O
me O
, O
from O
the O
guttering O
torches B-ART
to O
the O
ragrolled O
paint O
effect O
on O
the O
walls B-ART
that's O
meant O
to O
look O
like O
ancient O
stonework O

Unfortunately O
the O
rotting B-ART
skeleton I-ART
manacled O
to O
the O
wall O
is O
only O
too O
real O

A O
sign B-ART
on O
the O

the O

says O
'When O

I'd O
rather O
not O

There's O
a O

I'm O
in O
an O
underground O

From O
the O

I'd O
say O
this O
was O
Papa O

private O
den B-ART
, O
a O
place O
of O
sanctuary O
away O
from O
the O

A O

. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
entirely O
unclimbable O
, O
of O
course O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
rippled B-ART
and O
uneven O
, O
rising O
to O
sharp B-ART
blades I-ART
of I-ART
stone I-ART
near O
the O
edge O
. O
Mud B-ART
and O
pebbles O
are O
strewn O
everywhere O
, O
but O
there's O
no O
standing B-ART
water I-ART
, O
so O
yes O
a O
narrow B-ART
crawl I-ART
leads O
down O
in O
the O
far O
corner O
. O


You're O
on O
your O
hands B-ART
and O
knees O
in O
a O
throat O
of O
stone B-ART
. O
The O
roof B-ART
dips O
even O
lower O
ahead B-ART
. O
If O
you O
advance B-ART
, O
it'll O
be O
squirming O
forwards B-ART
on O
your O
belly O
. O
And O
squirming O
backwards B-ART
will O
be O
impossible O
, O
you O
think O
grimly O
. O


The O
crawl B-ART
is O
no O
different O
here O
than O
anywhere O
. O
You O
have O
just O
enough O
room O
to O
raise O
your O
head O
, O
and O
there's O
nothing O
to O
see O
ahead B-ART
but O
more O
stone B-ART
to O
crawl B-ART
through O
. O


The O
rock O
is O
lower O
above O
you O
. O
And O
narrower O
; O
you're O
lying O
full O
length O
now O
, O
your O
arms B-ART
stretched O
out O
ahead B-ART
, O
but O
still O
rough O
stone B-ART
scrapes O
your O
shoulders O
. O
And O
you O
seem O
to O
be O
angling O
a O
bit O
downwards O
. O


You O
lie O
on O
your O
side O
, O
gasping O
, O
trying O
to O
recover O
some O
strength O
. O
Your O
back B-ART
is O
sore O
; O
your O
neck O
is O
worse O
. O
Your O
head O
aches O
from O
cracking O
into O
unexpected O
stone B-ART
. O
A O
cold B-ART
stony O
knot O
presses O
into O
your O
left O
side O
, O
your O
right O
knee O
. O


You O
are O
lying O
in O
cold B-ART
still I-ART
water I-ART
. O
It O
licks O
at O
your O
cheek O
and O
arms B-ART
, O
and O
across O
the O
backs B-ART
of O
your O
thighs B-ART
. O
The O
chill O
makes O
your O
bruised O
knees O
and O
chest O
hurt O
all O
the O
more O
; O
your O
neck O
screams O
from O
craning O
high O
enough O
to O
breathe O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
room O
to O
sit O
up O
. O
No O
room O
to O
turn O
. O
No O
room O
. O


Water O
trickles O
over O
your O
hands B-ART
, O
but O
the O
floor O
must O
have O
risen O
; O
there O
is O
less O
of O
it O
. O
. O
. O
a O
note O
of O
hope O
. O
But O
you O
cannot O
see O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
smallish B-ART
roundish O
cave O
. O
Gravel B-ART
and I-ART
small I-ART
rock I-ART
chips I-ART
cover O
the O
ground B-ART
. O
Water O
trickles O
audibly O
, O
somewhere O
nearby O
. O
A O
path B-ART
runs O
right B-ART
, O
a O
steep B-ART
crack I-ART
heads O
left B-ART
, O
and O
a O
pit B-ART
climbs O
up O
. O


You O
are O
in O
an O
alcove O
, O
a O
side O
chamber O
at O
the O
base O
of O
a O
vaulting O
canyon B-ART
. O
The O
walls B-ART
spread O
upward O
around O
you O
. O
And O
the O
distant B-ART
roof I-ART
is O
hung O
with O
glimmering O
stars B-ART
droplet O
tipped O
stalactites B-ART
in O
some O
hidden O
suffusion O
of O
light B-ART
. O
A O
crevice B-ART
runs O
along O
the O
canyon B-ART
at O
your O
feet B-ART
. O
You O
can O
cross O
it O
and O
continue O
on O
ahead B-ART
, O
or O
re O
enter O
the O
crawl B-ART
behind I-ART
you O
. O


Massive O
buttresses B-ART
of I-ART
stone I-ART
rise O
all O
around O
you O
, O
climbing O
the O
canyon O
wall B-ART
, O
flowing O
down O
again O
in O
cascades O
of O
pale O
fluorite O
. O
A O
path B-ART
seems O
to O
climb O
up O
among O
them O
; O
but O
you O
don't O
think O
you O
can O
get O
to O
it O
right O
now O
. O


You O
are O
partway O
up O
the O
canyon O
wall B-ART
, O
on O
a O
narrow O
path B-ART
that O
climbs O
from O
ledge B-ART
to O
ledge B-ART

The O
cavern O
is O
vast O
around O
you O
, O
water O
hewn O
strata O
stretching O
upward O
to O
the O
stone B-ART
forest O
of O
the O
roof B-ART
; O
and O
somewhere O
above O
you O
, O
a O
crack O
of O
daylight O
sets O
it O
all O
glimmering O
. O
. O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
army O

You O
are O
in O
your O

Golden O
rays O
of O
the O
sun O
filter O
through O
the O
open O
tent B-ART
flaps I-ART
on O
the O
southern O
wall B-ART
, O
but O
no O
breeze O
makes O
its O
way O
through O
. O
The O
dry O
, O
searing O
heat O
in O
the O
tent B-ART
would O
be O
bearable O
if O
only O
the O
air B-ART
stirred O
, O
even O
a O

At O
the O
foot O
of O
the O

The O

see O
a O

to O

is O
the O
entrance O
to O
your O

Everything O
is O
oddly O
quiet O
, O
unsettling O
, O
creating O
a O
feeling O
of O
floating O
anxiety O
. O
The O
stillness O
seems O
to O
enhance O
the O
eerie O
quality O
of O
the O
desert B-ART
, O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
truly O
alone O
. O
There's O
a O
small O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
sand B-ART

a O

To O
the O
east O
you O
can O
see O
the O
central O
firepit O
, O
a O
reminder O

A O
row O
of O
thickets B-ART

impossible O
to O
make O
any O
progress O
through O
even O
with O
a O

of O
the O

Half O

To O

the O

your O

The O

an O
endless O
vista O
of O
fine O

burning O
sand B-ART
stretching O
out O
to O
the O

. O
There's O
an O

hole B-ART
in O
the O

a O

Tacked O
up O

Half O

Sitting O
by O
a O

what O
looks O

a O

A O
path O
to O
the O
south O
starts O
here O
, O
and O
you O
can O
see O
the O
riverbank O
clearly O
to O
the O
west O
. O
A O
warm O
, O
light O
breeze O
reaches O
your O
face O
, O
drying O
your O
sweat O
into O
a O
thin O
mask O
of O
salt O
. O
You O
glance O
to O
the O
north O
and O
are O
greeted O
by O
a O
disheartening O
sight O
an O
endless O
stretch O
of O
searing O
desert B-ART
. O


You O
are O
on O
the O
bank O
of O
the O
river B-ART
Nile I-ART
. O
The O
shoreline O
is O
sandy O
and O
cool O
, O
and O
reeds O
wave O
in O
a O
light O
but O
warm O
breeze O
. O
Directly O
to O
the O
north O
and O
the O
south O
thickets B-ART
make O
strolling O
along O
the O
bank O
impossible O
. O
You're O
hot O
, O
and O
the O
cool O
rippling O
water B-ART
to O
the O
west O
looks O
inviting O
, O
but O
you're O
not O
alone O
in O
that O
thought O
crocodiles B-ART
bask O
on O
the O
west O
bank O
, O
eyeing O
you O
hungrily O
, O
just O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
enter O
their O
watery B-ART
domain O
. O
Things O
were O
never O
like O
this O
when O
Craige O

You O
are O
on O
an O
east O
west O
path O
on O
the O
northern O
side O
of O
the O
encampment O
. O
To O
the O
east O
you O
can O
see O
the O
sites O
of O
previous O
excavations O
your O
workers O
had O
begun O
before O
they O
deserted B-ART
you O
. O
Low O
, O
gentle O
sand O
dunes O
roll O
out O
of O
sight O
to O
the O
north O
, O
but O
your O
camp's O
eastern O
border O
has O
a O
path O
, O
heading O
off O
to O
the O
south O
, O
which O
starts O
here O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
desert B-ART
, O
still O
within O
sight O
of O
the O
encampment O
, O
just O
a O
tiny O
oasis O
to O
the O
west O
. O
The O
tents B-ART
, O
shimmering O
behind O
the O
heat O
waves O
rising O
from O
the O
sand O
, O
seem O
to O
be O
calling O
you O
back O
, O
beckoning O
, O
offering O
safety O
and O
refuge O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
desert B-ART
, O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
the O
encampment O
. O
You O
are O
thankful O
there's O
no O
wind O
, O
even O
though O
a O
cooling O
breeze O
would O
be O
welcomed O
, O
since O
the O
fine O
sand O
particles O
would O
sting O
your O
face O
and O
hands O
. O
All O
around O
is O
the O
desert B-ART
, O
a O
sweeping O
expanse O
of O
disheartening O
sand O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
Chamber O
of O
Ra O
, O
a O
tribute O
to O
the O
Sun O
God O
. O
Even O
though O
the O
only O
natural O
light O
enters O
through O
the O
opening O
above O
, O
the O
room O
is O
brilliantly O
lit O
as O
though O
the O
walls B-ART
themselves O
generated O
light O
. O
The O
room O
slopes O
inward O
and O
the O
walls B-ART
meet O
at O
an O
open O
point O
, O
over O
your O
head O
. O
The O
heat O
of O
the O
desert O
filters O
down O
through O
the O
opening O
and O
, O
as O
the O
air O
slowly O
circulates O
, O
the O
deep O
, O
long O
dead O
musty O
odors O
from O
the O
depths O
of O
the O
pyramid O
assault O
your O
senses O
. O
Four O
staircases B-ART
descend O
from O
here O
a O
steep O

In O
the O

solidly O
in O
the O

is O
a O
small O

Leaning O
against O
the O

You O

on O
a O
landing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
set O
of O
stairs B-ART

The O
staircase B-ART
goes O
down O
to O
the O
south O
and O
up O
to O
the O
north O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
here O
are O
undistinguished O
, O
formed O
by O
the O
stones O
of O
which O
the O

You O

the O
Narrow O
Hallway O

The O

You're O
in O
the O
northwest O
corner O
of O
the O
Barge O
Chamber O

You O
can O
see O
by O
your O

that O
there's O
room O
enough O
to O
continue O
around O
the O
back O
of O
the O
barge O
by O
going O
to O
the O
east O
, O
while O
you O
can O
bypass O
the O
bow O
of O
the O

You O
are O
about O
midway O
down O
a O
steep O

descending O
, O
north O
south O
passageway O
which O
seems O
to O
lead O
out O
of O
the O
pyramid O
to O
the O
north O

The O
walls B-ART
of O
stone O
are O
polished O

as O
smooth O
as O

glistening O
in O
your O

lighting O
the O

heading O
back O

A O
large O
doorway B-ART
cut O
into O
the O
stone O
walls B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
north O
and O
, O
through O
it O

you O

You O
are O
in O
a O
huge O
chamber O
, O
immense O
in O
its O
size O
and O
scope O
, O
especially O
since O
it O
is O
far O
underground O

Your O
light O
seems O
to O
climb O
and O
fall O
from O
the O
high O
walls B-ART
, O
making O
their O
top O
boundaries O
undefined O
as O
they O

You O

make O
out O
the O

The O
ceiling O
here O
is O
lower O

low O
enough O
for O

There O
are O
some O
detailed O
hieroglyphs B-ART
on O
one O
of O
the O

Lying O
before O
you O
in O
tortured O

the O
bony O

of O
a O
former O

As O

is O
a O
stone O
slab B-ART
with O
a O
little B-ART

You O
can O
nearly O
smell O
the O
riches O
that O

be O
buried O
beneath O
your O
feet O
! O


This O
is O
a O
sandy O
pit O
with O
stone O
walls B-ART

You O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
able O
to O

The O
only O
thing O
here O
is O
a O
note B-ART
taped O

This O
is O
the O
south O
end O
of O
a O
long O
room O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
and O
floor O
and O
ceiling O
are O
covered O
with O
thousands O
of O
metal B-ART
gadgets I-ART
that O
you O
might O
want O

more O
carefully O
. O
There O
is O
a O
path O
free O
of O
gadgets B-ART
to O
the O
north O
end O
of O
the O
room O
. O


The O
door B-ART
is O
open O
. O
You O
see O
something O
glimmering O
behind O
the O

All O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
get O
it O
back O
to O
the O
encampment O
! O


The O
starting O
point O
for O
the O
final O
leg O
of O
any O
campaign's O
pursuit O
of O
the O
Jewel O
of O
Knowledge O
. O
The O
rocky O
terrain O
is O
surprisingly O
cool O
considering O
how O
far O
beneath O
the O
Earth's O
surface O
you've O
traveled O
. O
Loose O
lava B-ART
rocks I-ART
lie O
scattered O
around O
the O
area O
and O
a O
gaping O
hole B-ART
opens O
up O
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
about O
10 O
meters O
above O
you O
. O
You O
can O
travel O
west O
and O
northeast O
into O
open O
areas O
or O
north O
into O
a O
gaping O
lava B-ART
tube O
. O
A O
cool O
breeze B-ART
flows O
from O
the O
west O
to O
the O
northeast O
. O


This O
cavern O
features O
a O
change O
in O
rock O
type O
from O
molten O
to O
granite O
. O
You O
can O
feel O
a O
cool O
breeze B-ART
coming O
from O
the O
northwest O
tunnel O
and O
flowing O
to O
the O
east O
. O
In O
the O
dim O
light O
, O
you O
can O
also O
see O
passages O
heading O
west O
and O
southwest O
. O


The O
granite O
walls B-ART
in O
this O
corridor O
are O
peppered O
with O
outcroppings O
of O
different O
minerals B-ART
. O
The O
minerals B-ART
protrude O
like O
jagged O
teeth O
from O
the O
cave's O
walls B-ART
and O
you O
get O
chills O
down O
your O
spine O
as O
your O
glowing O
hands O
reflect O
off O
their O
surface O
. O
A O
gentle O
breeze B-ART
flows O
from O
the O
west O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


There O
is O
barely O
enough O
room O
to O
breathe O
in O
this O
vertical O
chute O
. O
You O
see O
a O
few O
precarious O
handholds O
above O
you O
, O
leading O
up O
to O
a O
narrow B-ART
slit I-ART
in O
the O
ceiling O
. O
You O
can O
also O
drop O
down O
through O
a O
tight O
crack B-ART
below O
you O
. O


This O
area O
looks O
very O
familiar O
. O
You've O
managed O
to O
crawl O
up O
to O
the O
5th O
layer B-ART
section O
from O
which O
you O
and O
Jacob O
originally O
fell O
from O
. O
Directly O
beneath O
you O
, O
you O
can O
see O
the O
narrow B-ART
slit I-ART
you O
just O
crawled O
up O
. O
To O
your O
right O
you O
can O
see O
the O
gaping B-ART
hole I-ART
that O
you O
fell O
through O
several O
hours O
earlier O
. O
Tunnels O
and O
chutes O
lead O
off O
in O
all O
directions O
. O


This O
room O
is O
generally O
quite O
a O
bit O
bigger O
than O
what O
you're O
used O
to O
underground O
. O
Towering O
stalactites B-ART
and I-ART
stalagmites I-ART
look O
like O
imposing O
sentinels O
standing O
guard O
in O
the O
dim O
light O
. O
Passages O
can O
be O
seen O
to O
the O
north O
and O
south O
. O
Also O
of O
interest O
are O
the O
set O
of O
stone O
steps B-ART
leading O
up O
to O
the O
west O
. O
These O
steps B-ART
are O
completely O
symmetrical O
and O
were O
obviously O
created O
by O
a O
master O
craftsman O
. O
Could O
it O
be O
that O
other O
humans O
or O
humanoids O
have O
preceded O
you O
to O
this O
level O
of O
the O
underground O
? O


You O
have O
entered O
a O
north O
south O
passage O
covered O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
with O
soft O
spongy B-ART
moss I-ART
. O
This O
room O
seems O
much O
more O
humid O
than O
the O
other O
places O
you've O
been O
to O
, O
but O
still O
maintains O
a O
cool O
room O
temperature O
. O
The O
floor O
of O
this O
cavern O
is O
covered O
with O
a O
thick O
layer O
of O
dirt B-ART
and O
you O
leave O
light O
tracks B-ART
on O
it O
as O
you O
walk O
across O
it O
. O
Strangely O
, O
you O
can O
also O
smell O
the O
faint O
trace O
of O
. O
. O
. O
cleaning O
solvent O
? O
Disinfectant O
? O
You're O
not O
too O
sure O
. O


You O
find O
yourself O
in O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
cramped O
closet B-ART
that O
was O
once O
used O
to O
store O
things O
. O
It's O
almost O
completely O
barren O
. O


This O
is O
a O
rather O
ordinary O
room O
with O
common O
geological O
structures O
such O
as O
stalagmites B-ART
, O
stalactites B-ART
, O
columns B-ART
, O
etc O
. O
Droplets B-ART
of I-ART
water I-ART
can O
be O
seen O
dripping O
to O
the O
floor O
from O
the O
cave's O
roof O
. O


The O
passage O
is O
quite O
tight O
here O
. O
You O
wish O
now O
that O
you O
hadn't O
eaten O
so O
much O
in O
the O
weeks O
preceding O
the O
expedition O
. O
A O
narrow B-ART
crack I-ART
opens O
to O
the O
west O
and O
a O
larger O
opening O
heads O
east O
. O
You O
can O
feel O
a O
cool O
breeze B-ART
coming O
from O
the O
west O
. O


In O
the O
centre O
of O
this O
room O
sits O
a O
perfectly O
round O
hole B-ART
with O
vapor B-ART
slowly O
sifting O
from O
it O
. O
A O
large O
shaft B-ART
, O
the O
top O
of O
which O
can't O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
dim O
light O
, O
heads O
up O
through O
the O
ceiling B-ART
. O
The O
vapor B-ART
from O
the O
hole B-ART
slowly O
trickles O
up O
a O
porous B-ART
, I-ART
cratered I-ART
wall I-ART
to O
the O
west O
and O
finally O
up O
through O
the O
shaft B-ART
. O
The O
ground O
here O
trembles O
softly O
. O


You O
are O
hanging O
off O
the O
wall B-ART
at O
the O
base B-ART
of O
a O
huge O
shaft B-ART
. O
An O
active O
geyser O
can O
be O
seen O
directly O
beneath O
you O
, O
and O
darkness O
leads O
up O
above O
you O
. O


You O
can O
no O
longer O
see O
the O
ground O
beneath O
you O
. O
The O
wall B-ART
you O
are O
clinging O
to O
is O
still O
climbable O
although O
you're O
not O
sure O
for O
how O
long O
. O


You've O
gone O
up O
about O
as O
far O
as O
you O
can O
go O
. O
The O
handholds O
above O
you O
are O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O
In O
the O
dim O
light O
you O
survey O
your O
surroundings O
. O
Mineral B-ART
veins I-ART
run O
through O
the O
rugged O
rock O
face O
, O
and O
a O
small O
ledge B-ART
is O
visible O
just O
east O
of O
your O
position O
. O


You're O
in O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
quarry B-ART
for O
the O
various O
kinds O
of O
ore O
found O
in O
this O
area O
. O
There O
must O
have O
been O
some O
sort O
of O
civilization O
or O
group O
of O
workers O
living O
down O
here O
at O
one O
point O
, O
because O
you O
notice O
the O
remains O
of O
firepits B-ART
and O
pieces O
of O
refuse B-ART
scattered O
around O
the O
site O
. O


The O
temperature O
in O
this O
room O
is O
considerably O
cooler O
than O
what O
you're O
used O
to O
in O
the O
underground O
. O
In O
fact O
there O
is O
a O
frosty B-ART
film I-ART
covering O
most O
of O
the O
rocks B-ART
in O
this O
area O
. O
What's O
really O
interesting O
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
HUGE O
glacier B-ART
like O
block B-ART
of I-ART
ice I-ART
filling O
up O
the O
entire O
south O
end O
of O
the O
cave O
! O


You're O
in O
a O
tight O
crawl B-ART
space I-ART
completely O
made O
of O
ice B-ART
. O
You O
thank O
the O
gods O
you're O
not O
claustrophobic O
or O
you'd O
have O
real O
problems O
right O
now O
. O
Passages O
lead O
to O
the O
north O
and O
southeast O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
room O
covered O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
with O
ice B-ART
and I-ART
snow I-ART
. O
The O
room O
temperature O
here O
is O
obviously O
below O
zero O
and O
you O
can O
see O
your O
own O
breath O
as O
you O
tremble O
across O
the O
frozen O
landscape O
. O
A O
tight O
passage O
leads O
northwest O
, O
and O
another O
smaller O
cavern O
can O
be O
seen O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
must O
be O
the O
White O
Dragon's O
private O
storage O
area O
. O
Gold B-ART
, I-ART
silver I-ART
and O
other O
precious B-ART
metals I-ART
can O
be O
seen O
lying O
around O
in O
abundance O
. O


This O
small O
alcove O
has O
at O
least O
ten O
different O
types O
of O
fungi B-ART
growing O
from O
the O
walls B-ART
. O


You O
vaguely O
recognize O
your O
surroundings O
as O
the O
Great O
Hall O
in O
the O
Druids' B-ART
Temple O
; O
however O
the O
colors B-ART
and O
dimensions O
seem O
somewhat O
distorted O
. O
You O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
hazy B-ART
mist I-ART
on O
all O
sides O
. O


You O
have O
entered O
a O
cavernous O
room O
made O
up O
of O
a O
dark O
rock O
that O
you O
don't O
recognize O
. O
The O
room O
continues O
east O
into O
a O
field O
of O
strange B-ART
fossilized I-ART
outcroppings B-ART
and O
southwest O
into O
another O
open O
area O
. O
A O
slight O
breeze B-ART
blows O
towards O
the O
field O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You're O
surrounded O
on O
all O
sides O
by O
a O
vast O
expanse O
of O
crags B-ART
, I-ART
craters I-ART
and I-ART
crevasses I-ART
. O
Growing O
from O
the O
rugged O
terrain O
are O
thousands O
of O
gypsum B-ART
flowers I-ART
, O
forming O
a O
mass O
of O
spiny O
pseudo O
claws O
, O
reaching O
out O
for O
the O
air B-ART
above O
. O
It's O
tough O
to O
tell O
which O
way O
is O
which O
in O
this O
enormous O
uncharted O
landscape O
. O
You O
can O
still O
feel O
that O
slight O
breeze B-ART
, O
but O
you O
can't O
really O
tell O
which O
way O
it's O
blowing O
anymore O
. O


The O
gypsum O
flower O
garden O
ends O
in O
this O
tiny B-ART
, O
dark O
alcove O
. O
To O
the O
east O
stands O
a O
huge O
door B-ART
made O
of O
a O
black O
stone O
that O
you O
don't O
recognize O
. O
It's O
about O
15 O
feet O
tall O
, O
and O
has O
a O
huge O
lock B-ART
on O
its O
face O
. O
The O
gypsum O
gardens O
can O
be O
seen O
back O
to O
the O
west O
and O
you O
can O
feel O
a O
slight O
breeze O
blowing O
east O
toward O
the O
door B-ART
. O


You're O
in O
a O
huge O
black B-ART
cavern O
. O
High O
atop O
the O
walls B-ART
, O
torches B-ART
keep O
the O
room O
well O
lit O
. O
The O
floor O
here O
is O
made O
of O
polished O
stone O
, O
which O
is O
quite O
uncommon O
in O
the O
underground O
. O
The O
room O
is O
quite O
tidy O
and O
you O
marvel O
at O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
isn't O
any O
dust O
! O
A O
passage O
leads O
off O
to O
the O
east O
and O
a O
rocky O
ramp B-ART
leads O
up O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


You've O
scrambled O
up O
onto O
the O
apex O
of O
the O
ramp O
. O
Unfortunately O
it's O
a O
dead O
end O
, O
and O
the O
only O
means O
of O
escape O
is O
back O
down O
the O
ramp O
. O
Huge O
boulders B-ART
sit O
precariously O
on O
this O
ledge O
. O
Through O
the O
boulders B-ART
you O
can O
see O
the O
Black B-ART
Dragon I-ART
, O
nursing O
his O
severed O
arm O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
at O
you O
while O
plotting O
his O
next O
move O
. O


Your O
eyes O
bug B-ART
out O
as O
you O
enter O
this O
room O
. O
There's O
gold B-ART
to O
the O
right O
of O
you O
, O
silver B-ART
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
all O
sorts O
of O
unimaginable O
treasures B-ART
just O
waiting O
to O
be O
discovered O
. O


This O
is O
it O
the O
final O
confrontation O
. O
You O
find O
yourself O
in O
a O
hollowed O
out O
piece O
of O
pure O
magma O
. O
The O
air B-ART
smells O
of O
sulfur O
dioxide O
and O
you O
cough O
lightly O
as O
you O
breathe O
it O
in O
. O
A O
river B-ART
of I-ART
lava I-ART
can O
be O
seen O
through O
a O
gap O
to O
the O
south O
and O
a O
river B-ART
of I-ART
water I-ART
flows O
to O
the O
north O
. O
A O
narrow O
strip O
of O
land O
divides O
the O
two O
rivers B-ART
as O
the O
room O
continues O
west O
to O
a O
plateau B-ART
over O
which O
a O
wooden B-ART
chandelier I-ART
hangs O
. O


You O
are O
midway O
between O
the O
entrance O
to O
this O
cave O
and O
the O
plateau B-ART
that O
the O
Red B-ART
Dragon I-ART
currently O
sits O
on O
. O
To O
the O
south O
flows O
a O
river B-ART
of I-ART
lava I-ART
, O
while O
to O
the O
north O
flows O
a O
river B-ART
of I-ART
water I-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
you O
see O
the O
Black B-ART
Dragon I-ART
limping O
in O
anticipation O
and O
to O
the O
west O
you O
see O
the O
mighty O
Red B-ART
Dragon I-ART
sitting O
under O
her O
chandelier B-ART
, O
looking O
increasingly O
agitated O
. O


A O
huge O
piece O
of O
molten O
rock O
juts O
out O
here O
, O
forming O
the O
plateau O
that O
the O
Red B-ART
Dragon I-ART
usually O
lies O
on O
. O
A O
river B-ART
of I-ART
lava I-ART
can O
be O
seen O
to O
the O
south O
and O
a O
river B-ART
of I-ART
water I-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O
High O
up O
above O
the O
plateau O
hangs O
a O
beautiful O
wooden B-ART
chandelier I-ART
. O


You're O
bobbing O
up O
and O
down O
like O
a O
buoy O
in O
the O
ocean O
, O
subject O
to O
the O
whim O
of O
the O
strong O
river B-ART
current O
. O
The O
water B-ART
is O
surprisingly O
cold O
, O
but O
fortunately O
you O
have O
your O
air B-ART
bladder I-ART
to O
keep O
you O
afloat O
. O


You're O
bobbing O
up O
and O
down O
in O
a O
river B-ART
of I-ART
cold I-ART
black I-ART
water I-ART
. O
Even O
your O
glowing B-ART
hands I-ART
don't O
light O
up O
the O
area O
as O
much O
as O
you'd O
like O
. O
The O
current O
is O
still O
pulling O
you O
west O
and O
the O
water B-ART
feels O
even O
colder B-ART
than O
before O
. O


This O
small B-ART
beach I-ART
is O
made O
up O
of O
tiny O
pebbles B-ART
from O
all O
sorts O
of O
different O
rocks B-ART
and I-ART
minerals I-ART
. O
The O
raging O
river B-ART
heads O
south O
and O
a O
shining O
light B-ART
can O
be O
seen O
coming O
from O
a O
small B-ART
passage O
to O
the O
north O
. O


Intricate O
tiles B-ART
and I-ART
tall I-ART
marble I-ART
columns I-ART
form O
the O
base O
of O
this O
magnificent O
room O
. O
The O
ceiling O
is O
high O
and O
arched O
and O
is O
cut O
from O
the O
same O
stone O
that O
the O
cavern O
is O
made O
of O
. O
Wooden B-ART
lattices I-ART
and O
beautifully O
painted O
murals B-ART
line O
every O
wall B-ART
and I-ART
light I-ART
radiates O
from O
an O
undetermined O
source O
. O


The O
console B-ART
room O
is O
the O
heart O
of O
operations O
of O
the O
TARDIS O
. O
Dominating O
the O
room O
is O
a O
six B-ART
side O
console B-ART
. O
Located O
above O
the O
console B-ART
is O
the O
scanner B-ART
. O
A O
corridor O
to O
the O
east O
leads O
further O
into O
the O
TARDIS O
. O
On O
the O
west O
side O
of O
the O
room O
are O
the O
main B-ART
doors I-ART
. O


This O
corridor O
, O
like O
almost O
all O
the O
corridors O
of O
the O
TARDIS O
, O
seems O
to O
stretch O
on O
forever O
. O
The O
console O
room O
lies O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
the O
corridor O
continues O
eastward O
into O
the O
distance O
. O
There's O
a O
closed O
door B-ART
on O
the O
south O
wall O
. O


This O
is O
the O
room O
where O
you O
do O
much O
of O
your O
tinkering O
with O
electronic O
gadgetry O
. O
Many O
a O
Rutan O
invasion O
or O
Dalek O
plot O
has O
been O
foiled O
by O
an O
ingenius O
invention O
you've O
thrown O
together O
at O
last O
minute O
in O
this O
room O
. O
In O
fitting O
with O
your O
work O
habits O
, O
it's O
usually O
a O
rather O
untidy O
place O
. O
However O
, O
in O
your O
latest O
fit O
of O
spring O
cleaning O
you've O
almost O
emptied O
the O
place O
out O
. O
There's O
a O
small O
cupboard B-ART
on O
the O
eastern O
wall O
, O
and O
on O
the O
north O
wall O
an O
open O
door B-ART
connects O
the O
workshop O
to O
the O
corridor O
outside O
. O


You're O
standing O
on O
a O
relatively O
flat O
piece O
of O
ground O
on O
the O
side O
of O
a O
mountain O
. O
Rocky B-ART
outgrowths O
stand O
like O
walls O
all O
around O
you O
. O
A O
trail O
through O
the O
rock B-ART
is O
visible O
to O
the O
east O
, O
while O
another O
trail O
to O
the O
northwest O
leads O
farther O
up O
the O
mountain O
. O


You O
stand O
before O
a O
huge O
pile O
of O
stone O
rubble B-ART
and O
charred O
debris B-ART
. O
You O
recognize O
this O
spot O
to O
be O
the O
site O
of O
Solon's O
castle O
. O
The O
castle O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
completely O
destroyed O
. O
You O
sense O
a O
slight O
psychic O
twinge O
in O
the O
air O
. O
This O
looks O
like O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Sisterhood O
. O


You're O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
cliff B-ART
that O
towers O
menacingly O
above O
you O
, O
merging O
with O
the O
murky O
sky O
above O
. O
A O
narrow O
cleft O
runs O
into O
the O
cliff B-ART
base O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
before O
a O
large O
murky O
lake B-ART
which O
stretches O
to O
the O
east O
as O
far O
as O
the O
eye O
can O
see O
. O
A O
steep O
slope O
leads O
northwards O
, O
and O
a O
trail O
winds O
its O
way O
through O
the O
rock O
to O
the O
west O
. O


The O
trail O
ends O
here O
at O
a O
rather O
small B-ART
ledge I-ART
which O
overlooks O
a O
precipitous O
drop O
of O
about O
30 O
feet O
. O
Be O
careful O
not O
to O
lose O
your O
footing O
here O
. O
Looking O
downwards O
, O
you O
are O
surprised O
to O
see O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
flying B-ART
saucer I-ART
parked O
below O
you O
. O
You O
can O
only O
safely O
move O
back O
down O
the O
sloping O
trail O
to O
the O
south O
. O


You're O
standing O
on O
the O
top O
of O
a O
small B-ART
flying I-ART
saucer I-ART
. O
It's O
difficult O
to O
keep O
your O
foothold O
here O
, O
as O
the O
saucer B-ART
is O
constructed O
of O
smooth O
, O
shiny O
metal O
. O
The O
end O
of O
your O
scarf B-ART
hangs O
down O
beside O
you O
from O
above O
. O
The O
surface O
of O
the O
saucer B-ART
is O
unbroken O
and O
featureless O
except O
for O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
small B-ART
hatch I-ART
. O


You're O
in O
a O
large O
area O
fairly O
clear O
of O
rocks O
and O
debris O
. O
Unclimbable O
walls O
of O
rock O
surround O
this O
area O
, O
but O
a O
path O
does O
lead O
between O
the O
rock O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O
About O
thirty O
feet O
above O
you O
, O
a O
ledge B-ART
is O
visible O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O
A O
long B-ART
, O
multi O
coloured O
scarf B-ART
dangles O
over O
the O
side O
of O
the O
ledge B-ART
above O
, O
just O
beyond O
your O
reach O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
dark O
passage O
carved O
into O
the O
rock O
. O
A O
tapestry B-ART
is O
drawn O
across O
the O
passage O
to O
the O
west O
. O
Dim O
light O
comes O
from O
underneath O
it O
. O
More O
light O
is O
visible O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
stand O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Sisterhood O
of O
Karn O
. O
The O
light O
here O
is O
very O
dim O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
candles B-ART
providing O
light O
. O
A O
throne B-ART
sits O
on O
a O
raised O
dias B-ART
here O
. O
On O
one O
wall O
you O
see O
a O
hinged O
metal B-ART
shield I-ART
, O
beneath O
which O
a O
large O
golden B-ART
chalice B-ART
sits O
upon O
a O
small B-ART
ledge I-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
tapestry B-ART
on O
the O
east O
wall O
, O
and O
a O
closed O
wooden B-ART
door I-ART
on O
the O
south O
wall O
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
a O
passageway O
leads O
out O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O


You O
seem O
to O
have O
reached O
a O
small B-ART
plateau O
, O
which O
overlooks O
a O
rocky B-ART
clearing O
far O
below O
. O
Below O
you O
can O
see O
the O
familiar O
blue O
shape O
of O
the O
TARDIS O
standing O
in O
the O
clearing O
. O
The O
stoney B-ART
trail O
terminates O
here O
, O
leading O
back O
downwards O
to O
the O
west O
. O


This O
room O
is O
very O
cramped O
, O
more O
like O
a O
large O
closet O
than O
a O
small B-ART

about O
five O

This O
courtyard O
is O
a O
triumph O
of O
modern O
architecture O
. O
It O
is O
spare O
, O
cold B-ART
, O
angular O
, O
overwhelming O
in O
size O
, O
and O
bears O
a O
striking O
resemblance O
to O
a O
wind O
tunnel B-ART
whenever O
the O
breeze O
picks O
up O
. O
Right O
now O
this O
is O
true O
of O
the O
whole O
campus O
, O
though O
. O
A O
huge O
mass B-ART
lurks O
nearby O
, O
and O
an O
almost O
featureless O
skyscraper O

What's O
deader O
than O
dead O
storage O
? O
That's O
what's O
in O
this O
room B-ART
. O
Most O
of O
the O
contents O
have O
collapsed O
or O
rusted O
back O
to O
the O
primordial O
ooze O

There O
is O
mold O
growing O
on O
some O
of O
the O
unidentifiable O
piles B-ART
. O
Stagnant O
puddles B-ART
of I-ART
water I-ART
pollute O
the O
floor O
. O
You O
can O
now O
believe O
how O
old O
some O
of O
these O
foundations O
are O
said O
to O
be O
. O


This O
is O
an O
ancient O
tunnel O
constructed O
of O
roughly O
mortared O
bricks B-ART
and I-ART
stones I-ART
. O
A O
slippery O
and O
almost O
invisible O
set O
of O
handholds B-ART
leads O
up O
. O
The O
tunnel O
continues O
a O
long O
way O
north O
and O
south O
from O
here O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
huge O
, O
cave O

construction O
. O
A O
path O
leads O
down O
to O
a O
floor O
partly O
covered O
with O
rough O
concrete O

In O
the O
center O
of O
the O
floor O
you O
can O
see O
a O
large O
, O
flat O
slab B-ART
of O
granite O

You O
are O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
cave O
. O
The O
huge O
slab B-ART
of O
granite O
in O
the O
center O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
altar B-ART
. O
It O
is O
carved O
with O
strange O
and O
disturbing O
symbols B-ART
, O
the O
largest O
of O
which O
looks O
very O
familiar O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
symbols B-ART
are O
obscured O
by O
rusty O
red O
stains O
. O
Nearby O
is O
an O
iron O
plate B-ART
set O
in O
the O
concrete O
of O
the O

This O
is O
a O
storage O
room B-ART
. O
It O
contains O
an O
incredible O
assemblage O
of O
discarded O
junk B-ART
. O
Some O
of O
it O
is O
so O
old O
and O
mouldering O
that O
you O
can't O
be O
sure O
where O
one O
bit O
of O
junk B-ART
stops O
and O
the O
next O
begins O
. O
It's O
piled B-ART
to O
the O
ceiling B-ART
on O
ancient O
, O
rotting O
pallets B-ART
. O
A O
narrow O
path O
winds O
eastward O
through O
the O
junk B-ART
. O


This O
corridor O
is O
lined O
with O
closed O
, O
dark O
offices B-ART
. O
At O
the O
south O
end O
of O
the O
corridor O
is O
a O
door B-ART
with O
a O
light B-ART
shining O
behind O
it O
. O
There O
is O
something O
written O
on O
the O
door B-ART
. O


This O
office O
is O
clinically O
clean O
, O
shiny O
, O
and O
modern O
. O
It O
looks O
like O
something O
out O
of O
a O
science O
fiction O
movie O
. O
A O
closed O
door B-ART
to O
the O
north O
leads O
back O
into O
the O
corridor B-ART
and O
an O
archway B-ART
opens O
to O
the O
south O
. O


The O
lab B-ART
is O
an O
ultramodern O
, O
fully O
equipped O
chemistry O
lab B-ART
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
or O
perhaps O
fortunately O
, O
you O
aren't O
a O
chemistry O
major O
, O
so O
the O
equipment O
might O
as O
well O
be O
magical O
. O


This O
is O
the O
subbasement O
of O
the O
Aeronautical O
Engineering O
Building O
. O
A O
stairway O
leads O
up O
. O
A O
narrow O
crack O
in O
the O
northwest O
corner O
of O
the O
room B-ART
opens O
into O
a O
larger O
space O
. O


This O
is O
a O
tiny O
, O
narrow O
, O
ill O
fitting O
room B-ART
. O
It O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
left O
over O
space O
from O
the O
joining O
of O
two O
preexisting O
buildings O
. O
It O
is O
roughly O
coffin O
shaped B-ART
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
covered O
by O
decades O
of O
overlaid O
graffiti B-ART
, O
but O
there O
is O
one O
which O
is O
painted O
in O
huge O
fluorescent O
letters B-ART
that O
were O
apparently O
impossible O
for O
later O
artists O
to O
completely O
deface O
. O
On O
the O
floor O
is O
a O
rusty O
access O
hatch B-ART
locked I-ART
with O
a O
huge O
padlock B-ART
. O


This O
dank O
and O
grimy O
tunnel B-ART
is O
largely O
filled O
with O
an O
imperfectly O
insulated O
steam O
pipe B-ART
. O
The O
tunnel B-ART
is O
uncomfortably O
hot O
and O
damp O
. O
You O
have O
gone O
from O
the O
arctic O
to O
the O
tropics O
. O
The O
concrete O
tunnel B-ART
has O
odd O
molds O
and O
fungi O
growing O
on O
its O
walls B-ART
and I-ART
ceiling I-ART
, O
and O
the O
floor O
is O
squishy O
. O
Torn O
clots O
of O
insulation O
litter O
the O
floor O
. O
Along O
the O
ceiling B-ART
runs O
a O
thick O
tangle O
of O
coaxial O
cable B-ART
. O
The O
tunnel B-ART
heads I-ART
east O
and O
west O
. O
A O
rusty O
metal O
ladder B-ART
leads O
up O
. O


A O
thick O
bundle O
of O
coaxial O
cable B-ART
runs O
east O
to O
west O
along O
the O
ceiling B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
pressure O
release O
valve B-ART
on O
the O
steam O
pipe B-ART
here O
. O


The O
steam O
tunnel O
is O
narrow O
here O
, O
and O
its O
construction O
is O
more O
archaic O
. O
It's O
now O
mostly O
brick O
, O
although O
the O
floor O
is O
concrete O
. O
The O
steam O
pipe B-ART
and O
coaxial O
cable B-ART
continue O
along O
their O
appointed O
paths O
. O
The O
tunnel O
is O
damp O
and O
even O
a O
little O
muddy O
. O


The O
steam O
pipe B-ART
and O
coaxial O
cable B-ART
turn O
upwards O
and O
disappear O
into O
the O
ceiling B-ART
here O
. O
The O
tunnel O
itself O
comes O
to O
an O
end O
in O
a O
grimy O
, O
damp O
, O
and O
dripping O
triad O
of O
crumbling O
brick B-ART
walls I-ART
. O
The O
south O
wall O
looks O
particularly O
decrepit O
. O


This O
small O
room B-ART
is O
pretty O
bare O
and O
featureless O
. O
The O
north O
wall O
is O
brick B-ART
and O
the O
other O
three O
walls B-ART
are O
concrete O
. O
The O
east O
and O
west O
walls B-ART
are O
adorned O
with O
rails B-ART
not O
unlike O
railroad O
rails B-ART
. O
Above O
you O
and O
out O
of O
reach O
, O
the O
shaft B-ART
is O
blocked O
by O
something O
. O


A O
bundle O
of O
coaxial O
cable B-ART
runs O
along O
the O
ceiling B-ART
, O
festooned O
with O
damp O
mold O
and O
cobwebs O
. O
The O
tunnel O
continues O
west O
. O


The O
tunnel O
continues O
west O
from O
here O
, O
becoming O
narrow O
, O
muddy O
, O
and O
forbidding O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
no O
longer O
seem O
to O
be O
as O
finished O
as O
they O
were O
. O
The O
steam O
pipe O
and O
coaxial O
cable B-ART
disappear O
into O
the O
ceiling B-ART
at O
this O
point O
. O
The O
temperature O
has O
dropped O
considerably O
, O
as O
well O
. O


This O
is O
a O
wide O
spot O
in O
the O
tunnel B-ART
, O
just O
as O
wet O
and O
muddy O
as O
elsewhere O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
slimy O
as O
well O
. O
Numerous O
slots B-ART
or O
indentations O
about O
two O
feet B-ART
wide O
and O
a O
foot B-ART
high O
open O
here O
and O
there O
. O
Thin O
, O
wire B-ART
or O
ropelike B-ART
growths B-ART
emerge O
from O
a O
hole B-ART
further O
down O
and O
enter O
each O
of O
the O
slots B-ART
. O
There O
is O
background O
noise B-ART
here O
, O
almost O
loud O
enough O
to O
hear O
clearly O
. O


You O
are O
lost O
in O
narrow O
, O
wet O
tunnels O
burrowed O
through O
the O
mud O
. O
Muddy O
, O
oily O
water B-ART
covers O
the O
floor O
. O
A O
curtain B-ART
of O
moldy O
slime B-ART
covers O
the O
south O
wall B-ART
. O


The O
floor O
here O
is O
a O
stagnant O
, O
slime O
infested O
pool B-ART
of I-ART
water I-ART
. O
It O
feels O
to O
be O
about O
six O
inches O
deep O
. O
Ropes O
or O
wires O
tumble O
down O
the O
slope O
, O
where O
they O
enter O
a O
large O
whitish O
mass B-ART
which O
takes O
up O
much O
of O
the O
chamber B-ART
. O
The O
noise B-ART
is O
loud O
here O
, O
and O
comes O
from O
the O
mass B-ART
, O
which O
undulates O
in O
synchrony O
with O
the O
noise B-ART
. O
Wan O
, O
sourceless O
light B-ART
illuminates O
the O
chamber B-ART
. O


Moonlight O
diffuses O
through O
the O
walls B-ART
, O
tracing O
out O
unreadable O
sigils B-ART
in O
calligraphies B-ART
of I-ART
light I-ART

dark I-ART
. O
Stairs B-ART
adorned O
with O
bas B-ART

Curiously O
, O
the O
only O
weapons B-ART
here O
live O
amid O
light B-ART
and O
cannot O
be O
worn O
they O
are O
silhouettes B-ART
flung O
against O
the O
walls B-ART
. O
Stairs B-ART
carved O
with O
bas B-ART

that O
continue O
into O
the O

The O
path O

to O
lead O
into O
some O
rather O
rocky B-ART
territory I-ART

the O
entrance O

, O
forming O
what O
looks O

two O
rather O
large O

A O
passage O
to O
the O

appears O
to O
go O
around O
the O
larger B-ART
boulder I-ART
, O
while O
a O
narrow O
gap B-ART
to O
the O
southeast O
seems O
to O
go O
around O
the O
smaller B-ART

A O
passage O
to O
the O
east O
cuts O
the O
rock B-ART

When O

Your O
footsteps O
echo O
loudly O
as O
you O
walk O
through O
this O
room O
taking O
in O
the O
vast O
expanse O
of O
its O
size O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
rise O
majestically O
upward O
and O
outward O
to O
form O
a O
huge O
room O
which O
, O
curiously O
, O
is O
empty O
. O
You O
can't O
help O
but O
wonder O
why O
such O
a O
large O
room O
is O
needed O
for O
the O
straight O
forward O
task O
of O
accepting O
guests O
and O
visitors O
. O
To O
the O
east O
a O
wide O
open O
arch O
leads O
to O
what O
must O
be O
a O
library O
while O
to O
the O
north O
you O
hardly O
help O
but O
notice O
a O
huge O
, O
semi O
circular O
marble O
staircase O
leading O
up O
to O
parts O
unknown O
. O


This O
is O
a O
vast O
chamber O
lined O
floor O
to O
ceiling B-ART
with O
bookcases B-ART
filled O
to O
capacity O
with O
books B-ART
. O
You O
haven't O
seen O
such O
a O
collection O
of O
knowledge O
since O
your O
academy O
days O
. O
A O
cursory O
glance O
at O
some O
bookshelves B-ART
reveal O
several O
titles O
on O
various O
topics O
of O
magic O
, O
history O
, O
philosophy O
, O
science O
and O
a O
hundred O
other O
topics O
. O
A O
few O
large O
tables B-ART
with O
chairs B-ART
are O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
inviting O
anyone O
to O
make O
use O
of O
these O
impressive O
facilities O
. O


This O
once O
majestic O
room O
was O
where O
visitors O
would O
come O
to O
relax O
and O
meet O
with O
the O
formal O
lord O
of O
the O
castle O
in O
a O
somewhat O
informal O
atmosphere O
. O
Several O
large O
comfortable O
couches B-ART
are O
scattered O
about O
, O
dusty O
and O
altogether O
squalid O
. O
Many O
large O
tapestries B-ART
still O
hang O
on O
the O
walls B-ART
but O
are O
horribly O
faded O
from O
age O
. O
Large O
open O
archways O
lead O
east O
and O
west O
while O
a O
huge O
fireplace O
dominates O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
against O
the O
northern O
wall B-ART
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
northern O
end O
of O
the O
main O
hall O
taking O
in O
the O
panorama O
of O
what O
was O
once O
a O
majestic O
area O
where O
perhaps O
treaties O
were O
signed O
, O
strategies O
laid O
and O
plans O
foiled B-ART
. O


The O
Duke O
wasn't O
one O
to O
stand O
on O
ceremony O
therefore O
he O
took O
all O
his O
meals O
in O
this O
room O
. O
This O
large O
room O
allowed O
many O
servers O
to O
shuttle O
back O
and O
forth O
from O
the O
kitchen O
to O
the O
north O
without O
getting O
in O
anyone's O
way O
. O
Dominating O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
is O
a O
long O
, O
grand O
table B-ART
lined O
with O
comfortable O
looking O
high O
backed O
chairs B-ART
while O
exquisite O
paintings B-ART
dot O
the O
walls B-ART
. O


Many O
death O
dealing O
weapons O
of O
every O
type O
were O
stored O
here O
. O
Several O
tall O
racks O
probably O
held O
spears O
while O
shorter O
ones O
mounted O
against O
the O
wall B-ART
stored O
various O
kinds O
of O
swords B-ART
. O
Other O
wall B-ART
mounts O
, O
also O
empty O
, O
give O
you O
no O
idea O
what O
sort O
of O
weapons O
may O
have O
been O
held O
by O
them O
. O
A O
large O
archway O
north O
is O
partially O
blocked O
by O
collapsed O
stones O
and O
rubble O
. O


In O
times O
past O
the O
vast O
wealth O
of O
the O
Duke O
would O
be O
stored O
here O
. O
Alas O
, O
with O
the O
castle O
taken O
and O
the O
Duke O
gone O
so O
with O
him B-ART
went O
his O
riches O
. O
As O
you O
remember O
your O
history O
lessons O
, O
you O
recall O
the O
genealogy O
of O
the O
Dukes O
of O
Bostwin O
and O
their O
love O
of O
collecting O
treasures O
. O
You O
could O
only O
imagine O
what O
vast O
treasures O
were O
contained O
in O
this O
room O
long O
ago O
. O


Looking O
around O
this O
large O
room O
you O
are O
astonished O
to O
learn O
that O
someone O
gutted O
this O
entire O
floor O
. O
You O
are O
looking O
out O
on O
one O
, O
huge O
room O
. O
No O
other O
rooms O
, O
no O
walls B-ART
of O
any O
kind O
apart O
from O
the O
ones O
enclosing O
this O
gigantic O
area O
just O
nothing O
but O
empty O
room O
as O
far O
as O
you O
can O
see O
. O


This O
is O
a O
featureless O
corridor O
similar O
to O
every O
other O
corridor O
on O
the O
ship O
. O
It O
curves O
away O
to O
starboard O
, O
and O
a O
gangway B-ART
leads O
up O
. O
To O
port O
is O
the O
entrance O
to O
one O
of O
the O
ship's O
primary O
escape O
pods B-ART
. O
The O
pod B-ART
bulkhead I-ART
is O
closed O
. O


The O
pod B-ART
door I-ART
clangs O
shut O
as O
heavy O
explosions O
continue O
to O
buffet O
the O
Feinstein O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
safety O
web O
. O
This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
Feinstein's O
primary O
escape O
pods B-ART
, O
for O
use O
in O
extreme O
emergencies O
. O
A O
mass B-ART
of O
safety O
webbing B-ART
, O
large O
enough O
to O
hold O
several O
dozen O
people O
, O
fills O
half O
the O
pod B-ART
. O
The O
controls B-ART
are O
entirely O
automated O
. O
The O
bulkhead B-ART
leading O
out O
is O
closed O
. O
You O
feel O
the O
pod B-ART
begin O
to O
slide O
down O
its O
ejection O
tube O
as O
explosions O
shake O
the O
mother O
ship O
. O


You O
have O
reached O
a O
cleft O
in O
the O
cliff O
wall O
where O
the O
island O
rises O
from O
the O
water O
. O
The O
edge O
of O
the O
cleft O
displays O
recently O
exposed O
rock O
where O
it O
collapsed O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
escape O
pod O
. O
About O
two O
meters O
below O
, O
turbulent O
waters O
swirl O
against O
sharp O
rocks O
. O
A O
small O
structure B-ART
clings O
to O
the O
face O
of O
the O
cliff O
about O
eight O
meters O
above O
you O
. O
Even O
an O
out O
of O
shape O
Ensign O
Seventh O
Class O
could O
probably O
climb O
up O
to O
it O
. O


This O
is O
an O
octagonal O
room O
, O
half O
carved O
into O
and O
half O
built O
out O
from O
the O
cliff O
wall O
. O
Through O
the O
shattered O
windows B-ART
which O
ring O
the O
outer O
wall O
you O
can O
see O
ocean B-ART
to O
the O
horizon O
. O
A O
weathered O
metal O
plaque B-ART
with O
barely O
readable O
lettering O
rests O
below O
the O
windows B-ART
. O
The O
language O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
corrupt O
form O
of O
Galalingua O
. O
A O
steep O
stairway B-ART
, O
roughly O
cut O
into O
the O
face O
of O
the O
cliff O
, O
leads O
upward O
. O
A O
rocky O
crag O
can O
be O
seen O
about O
eight O
meters O
below O
. O


The O
middle O
of O
a O
long O
, O
steep O
stairway B-ART
carved O
into O
the O
face O
of O
a O
cliff O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
courtyard O
of O
an O
ancient O
stone O
edifice O
, O
vaguely O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
castles B-ART
you O
saw O
during O
your O
leave O
on O
Ramos O
Two O
. O
It O
has O
decayed O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it O
can O
probably O
be O
termed O
a O
ruin O
. O
Openings O
lead O
north O
and O
west O
, O
and O
a O
stairway B-ART
downward O
is O
visible O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
is O
a O
wide O
, O
east O
west O
hallway O
with O
a O
large O
portal O
to O
the O
south O
. O
A O
small O
door B-ART
to O
the O
north O
is O
closed O
and O
hooked O
with O
a O
simple O
steel O
padlock B-ART
which O
is O
also O
closed O
. O


This O
is O
a O
wide O
, O
east O

hallway O
with O
openings O
to O
the O
north O

. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
the O
corridor O
stretches O
off O
into O
the O
distance O
. O
That O
section O
of O
the O
hallway O
is O
lined O
with O
a O
motorized O
walkway B-ART
no O
longer O
running O
that O
was O
probably O
intended O
to O
transport O
people O
or O
cargo O
down O
that O
tremendously O
long O
hall O
. O


A O
north O
south O
corridor O
intersects O
the O
main O
corridor O
here O
. O
To O
the O
west O
, O
the O
main O
corridor O
extends O
as O
far O
as O
you O

walkway B-ART
from O
that O
direction O
ends O
here O
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
the O
corridor O
widens O
into O
a O
well O
lit O
area O
. O


This O
section O
of O
hallway O
seems O
to O
have O
suffered O
some O
minor O
structural O
damage O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
cracked B-ART
, O
and O
a O
jagged O
crevice B-ART
crosses O
the O
floor O
. O
An O
opening O
leads O
east O
and O
the O
corridor O
heads O
north O
and O
south O
. O


On O
a O
small O
shelf B-ART
is O
a O
large O
, O
unopened O
tin O

A O
heavy O

leaning O
against O
the O
rear O
wall O

The O
hallway O
, O
in O
fact O
the O
entire O
building O
, O
has O
been O
rent O
apart O
here O
, O
presumably O
by O
seismic O
upheaval O
. O
You O
can O
see O
the O
sky O
through O
the O
severed O
roof O
above O
, O
and O
the O
ground O
is O
thick O
with O
rubble O
. O
To O
the O

According O
to O
legends O
you O
read O
at O
the O
University O
, O
the O
eastern O
shore B-ART
of O
this O
ocean B-ART
is O
a O
strange O
land O
of O
magical O
beings O

You O
could O
go O
north O
along O
the O
shore B-ART

the O
edge O
of O
a O

A O
mighty O
river B-ART

into O
the O
ocean B-ART
here O
. O
Looking O
up O
the O
river B-ART
valley O
, O
you O
see O
a O
tall O
waterfall B-ART
. O
Atop O
a O
cliff O
, O
high O
above O
you O
, O
is O
the O

A O
pack B-ART
of I-ART

fills O
the O

The O
grues B-ART
, O
contrary O
to O
all O
conventional O
wisdom O
, O
aren't O
bothered O
by O
your O

They O
must O
be O

no O

They O
seem O

of O
extraordinary O
size O

nevertheless O
crowded O
with O
powerful O

You O
recognize O
a O
breeder B-ART
for O
producing O
millions O
of O
the O

you O
just O

. O


An O
acrid O
stench O
fills O
this O
small O

which O
is O
obviously O
a O
control O

for O
the O

what O
with O
the O

a O
trackless O
wilderness B-ART

The O
roc B-ART
perches O
on O
the O

of O
the O

, O
watching O
you O
intently O
. O
There O
is O
a O
stained O
scroll B-ART
here O
. O


This O
is O
a O
long O
hall O
built O
of O
crudely O
dressed O
stone B-ART

The O
blocks B-ART
are O
as O
tall O
as O
you O
and O
the O

invisible O
in O
the O
gloom O
above O
. O
Dirt O
trickles O
from O
gaps O
in O
the O
walls O

. O
The O
atmosphere O
is O
oppressive O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
dry O
, O
stale O
smell O
all O
around O
. O
The O
corridor O
extends O
north O
and O
south O
from O
here O
. O


Here O
the O
main O
corridor O
opens O
into O
a O
vast O
underground O
space O
. O
Your O
light O
can O
barely O
illuminate O
a O
fraction O
of O
it O
. O
All O
around O
are O
cyclopean O
blocks B-ART
of O
stone O
, O
crudely O
carved O
statues B-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
constructs I-ART
of O
unimaginable O
purpose O

Nearby O
the O
portico B-ART
of O
a O
building O
has O
collapsed O
, O
and O
a O
pillar B-ART
has O
smashed O
the O
pavement O
and O
exposed O
a O
small O
channel B-ART
filled O
with O
swiftly O
rushing O
water O
. O
Water O
stains O
indicate O
that O
at O
one O
time O
the O
water O
flooded O
the O
entire O
area O
. O
Wedged O
against O
a O
pillar B-ART
, O
as O
though O
by O
rushing O
water O
, O
is O
a O

This O
is O
the O
upper O
end O
of O
a O
narrow O
, O
winding O
path B-ART
up O
a O
sheer O
cliff B-ART
. O
From O
here O
you O
can O
see O
that O
any O
further O
extension O
of O
the O
path B-ART
was O
destroyed O
by O
a O
rock O
slide O
at O
some O
relatively O
recent O
time O
. O
There O
are O
many O
rocks B-ART
precariously O
balanced O
above O
you O
. O
It O
looks O
like O
the O
slightest O
disturbance O
could O
bring O
them O
down O
on O
you O
. O
Frustratingly O
, O
you O
can O
see O
the O
remains O
of O
a O
small O
building B-ART
just O
beyond O
the O
dangerous O
area O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
get O
there O
from O
here O
. O


You O
are O
clinging O
to O
a O
boulder B-ART
that O
is O
floating O
in O
midair O
. O
There O
are O
many O
other O
boulders B-ART
around O
, O
also O
floating O
, O
and O
lots O
of O
dust O
and O
dirt O
, O
also O
not O
moving O

One O
particularly O
large O
boulder B-ART
with O
good O
handholds O
is O
above O
you O
. O
Below O
you O
is O
the O
cliff O

A O
nice O
oblong O

Below O
you O
is O
a O
long O
oblong O
boulder B-ART
. O
Above O
you O
there O
are O
no O
more O
boulders B-ART
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
continuation O
of O
the O
trail O
that O
you O
were O
on O
. O


This O
is O
the O
top O
of O
the O
mountain B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
crudely O
built O
stone B-ART
hut I-ART
nearby O
to O
the O
west O
. O
There O
is O
a O
gold O
coin B-ART
here O
. O


The O
hut B-ART
is O
made O
of O
irregular O
stones B-ART
. O
The O
walls O
are O
chinked O
with O
moss B-ART
, I-ART
mud I-ART
, O
small O
stones B-ART
, O
a O
featureless O
white O
cube B-ART
, O
and O
an O
occasional O
old O
fur B-ART
. O


There O
is O
a O
pair O
of O
pruning O
shears B-ART
here O
. O
There O
is O
a O
weed B-ART
plant I-ART
here O
. O
It's O
tall O
, O
with O
yellow O
blossoms O
dripping O
pollen O
. O


A O
well O
worn O
trail B-ART
terminates O
here O
where O
a O
cave B-ART
enters O
the O
cliff B-ART
side O
to O
the O
north O
. O
Outside O
the O
cave B-ART
is O
a O
litter B-ART
of I-ART
bones I-ART
, O
old O
hides B-ART
and I-ART
brush I-ART
. O
The O
smell O
that O
issues O
from O
the O
cave B-ART
is O
mephitic O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
sheer O
cliff B-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
natural O
fissure O
in O
the O
rock O
which O
was O
enlarged O
with O
crude O
skill O
into O
a O
spacious O
and O
comfortable O
room B-ART
, O
at O
least O
if O
you're O
fond O
of O
caves B-ART
. O
The O
floor O
is O
dirt B-ART
, O
hard O
packed O
in O
some O
parts O
, O
loose O
in O
others O
. O
A O
low O
passage O
leads O
down O
. O
A O
large O
ogre B-ART
bars O
the O
passage O
. O


There O
is O
a O
dusty B-ART
scroll B-ART
here O
. O
There O
is O
a O
gold O
box B-ART
here O
. O


This O
is O
a O
damp O
, O
mossy B-ART
room B-ART
. O
Its O
floor O
is O
mud B-ART
, O
and O
its O
walls O
and O
ceiling O
are O
coral B-ART
. O
In O
the O
gaps O
in O
the O
coral B-ART
you O
can O
see O
a O
shimmering O
film B-ART
which O
you O
realize O
is O
actually O
the O
outer O
edge O
of O
a O
huge O
bubble B-ART
of O
air O
enclosing O
you O
. O
On O
the O
north O
, O
east O
and O
south O
sides O
of O
the O
room B-ART
are O
curtains O
of O
bubbles B-ART
. O


This O
is O
an O
oubliette O
. O
Sheer O
walls O
rise O
for O
twenty O
feet O
above O
you O
and O
lean O
inward O
to O
a O
narrow O
opening B-ART
covered O
with O
wooden O
planks O
. O
A O
small O
but O
fast O
flowing O
channel B-ART
of O
water O
runs O
along O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
chamber B-ART
between O
two O
pipes B-ART
. O


You O
are O
inside O
a O
small O
ceramic O
pipe B-ART
nearly O
filled O
with O
fast O
flowing O
cold O
water O
. O
The O
walls O
of O
the O
pipe B-ART
are O
slippery O
and O
overgrown O
with O
mossy B-ART
slime B-ART
wherever O
an O
irregularity O
shields O
the O
growth O
from O
the O
force O
of O
the O
water O
. O
Going O
east O
against O
the O
current O
would O
be O
nearly O
impossible O
. O
Going O
west O
is O
almost O
unavoidable O
. O


On O
the O
north O
side O
of O
the O
pipe B-ART
is O
such O
an O
irregularity O
a O
large O
chunk B-ART
has O
been O
knocked O
out O
of O
the O
pipe B-ART
, O
and O
the O
slime B-ART
and I-ART
moss I-ART
grows O
abundantly O
. O
Inside O
, O
covered O
with O
moss B-ART
and I-ART
slime I-ART
, O
is O
something O
large O
, O
white O
, O
and O
apparently O
cubical O
. O


The O
pipe B-ART
here O
is O
smashed O
from O
the O
top O
where O
a O
huge O
pillar O
has O
toppled O
over O
onto O
it O
. O
Cyclopean O
ruins O
are O
all O
around O
you O
. O
The O
cracks O
and O
fissures O
in O
the O
pipe B-ART
might O
make O
it O
possible O
to O
climb O
out O
here O
. O
The O
water O
is O
fast O
and O
loud O
around O
you O
. O


Here O
a O
long O
north O
south O
corridor O
meets O
an O
east O
west O
cross O
corridor O
whose O
walls O
are O
polished O
to O
almost O
mirror O
smoothness O
. O
Just O
to O
your O
north O
is O
a O
huge O
scaly O
mass B-ART
which O
fills O
the O
entire O
cross O
corridor O
. O
Its O
thickness O
is O
more O
than O
three O
times O
your O
height O
and O
its O
length O
is O
unguessable O
. O


Just O
to O
your O
south O
is O
a O
large O
snake B-ART
whose O
head O
pokes O
out O
of O
one O
side O
of O
the O
cross O
corridor O
and O
the O
tip O
of O
whose O
tail O
pokes O
out O
the O
other O
side O
. O
You O
can O
see O
that O
ahead O
is O
more O
of O
the O
crudely O
built O
main O
hall O
, O
and O
beyond O
that O
is O
a O
dark O
area O
. O


This O
is O
a O
ruined B-ART
temple O
to O
a O
forgotten O
god B-ART
. O
Black O
basalt O
pillars B-ART
reach O
to O
the O
ceiling O
, O
but O
some O
are O
broken O
and O
lie O
in O
huge O
fragments B-ART
on O
the O
ground O
. O
The O
air O
is O
stale O
and O
filled O
with O
the O
odor O
of O
decay O
. O
Bats B-ART
roost O
in O
the O
rafters B-ART
, O
the O
only O
remaining O
worshippers O
. O
Before O
the O
temple O
stands O
a O
tall O
basalt O
idol B-ART
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
huge O
rodent O
. O
Its O
fang B-ART
bedecked O
mouth B-ART
is O
open O
slightly O
, O
exposing O
teeth B-ART
and O
tongue O
. O


Its O
fang B-ART
bedecked O
mouth B-ART
is O
open O
in O
an O
embarrassing O
yawn O
. O


You O
are O
on O
a O
large O
fluffy O
white O
cloud O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
you O
are O
surrounded O
by O
clouds B-ART
. O
They O
blow O
past O
, O
wind O
seeming O
to O
boil O
them O
around O
you O
from O
all O
sides O
. O
There O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
clear O
air O
to O
the O
north O
, O
momentary O
gaps O
in O
the O
clouds B-ART
to O
the O
south O

, O
and O
an O
alarming O
one O
below O
you O
. O


Directly O
in O
front O
of O
you O
to O
the O
east O
is O
a O
shop O
. O
Above O
its O
door B-ART
is O
a O
sign B-ART
in O
an O
unknown O
tongue O
. O
You O
can't O
read O
it O
, O
but O
it O
is O
illustrated O
with O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
very O
ornate O
rug O
. O
The O
door B-ART
beckons O
invitingly O
. O


A O
young O
and O
earnest O
looking O
merchant B-ART
stands O
near O
a O
pile B-ART
of O
carpets O
. O
He O
is O
carrying O
in O
his O
arms O
a O
beautiful O
blue O
carpet O
with O
a O
design O
of O
cubes O
on O
it O
and O
a O
scruffy O
red O
carpet O
that's O
shabby O
and O
badly O
made O
. O


It O
is O
completely O
full O
of O
icy O
water O
. O
Sheer O
walls O
enclose O
it O
on O
all O
sides O
. O
In O
the O
ceiling O
is O
a O
narrow O
opening B-ART
. O


The O
hall O
ends O
at O
a O
blank O
wall O
, O
but O
a O
cell B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
north O
. O
There O
is O
no O
door O
on O
the O
cell B-ART
. O


This O
was O
once O
a O
very O
luxurious O
cell B-ART
, O
obviously O
for O
the O
imprisonment O
of O
a O
highborn O
or O
powerful O
person O
. O
Its O
rich O
hangings B-ART
are O
now O
rotten O
rags B-ART
; O
its O
furniture O
is O
smashed O
to O
kindling O
, O
except O
for O
one O
massive O
oak O
cabinet B-ART
. O
The O
cell B-ART
door O
has O
been O
blown O
away O
by O
an O
explosion O
, O
or O
perhaps O
a O
rezrov O
spell B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
guard O
tower B-ART
of O
a O
crumbling O

landscape O
of O
tarns B-ART

The O
only O
real O

provided O
by O
a O
distant O
volcano B-ART
which O
lights B-ART
the O
lowering O

with O
bright O
red O

A O

This O

a O
flat O

The O

on O
the O
eerie O
surface O

propelled O
by O
an O

The O
ground O
is O
scratched B-ART
by O
many O

lines B-ART
which O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
regular O
pattern O
. O
From O
where O
you O

standing O
you O
can O
see O
lines B-ART

north O

. O
There O
is O
a O
large O
green O

Also O
, O
there O
is O
a O
large O
brown O

rock B-ART
with O
a O
featureless O
white O
cube B-ART
on O
its O
back O
some O
distance O
to O
the O

Far O
in O
the O
distance O
are O
mountains B-ART
which O
quiver O
itchily O
as O
they O
belch O
forth O
purple O
fire O
. O


You O
are O
on O
a O
large O

green O

This O
room B-ART
is O
totally O
black O
, O
so O
black O
that O
you O
see O
nothing O
when O
you O
look O
around O
it O
. O
All O
light O
is O
absorbed O
by O
the O
substance O
of O
the O
place O
. O
You O
can O
tell O
it O
is O
physical O
, O
because O
you O
can O
feel O
your O
feet O
touching O
the O
floor O
, O
but O
your O
eyes O
tell O
you O
nothing O
. O


This O
is O
a O
large O
cave B-ART
with O
a O
rough O
floor O
. O
You O
can O
tell O
little O
about O
the O
surroundings O
, O
because O
your O
frotz O
spell B-ART
doesn't O
seem O
to O
be O
working O
normally O
here O
and O
produces O
only O
a O
wan O
and O
sickly O
glow O
. O
The O
light B-ART
coming O
from O
the O
magic O
burin B-ART
has O
been O
reduced O
to O
a O
thin O
, O
barely O
glowing O
stream O
of O
tiny O
blobs O
that O
drips O
, O
spurts O
and O
sputters O
uselessly O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
There O
it O
collects O
into O
a O
small O
pile B-ART
which O
is O
slowly O
disappearing O
, O
perhaps O
by O
evaporation O
. O


This O
is O
a O
large O
underground O
chamber B-ART
filled O
with O
nightmarish O
, O
barely O
visible O
shapes B-ART
. O
There O
is O
very O
dim O
light B-ART
issuing O
from O
somewhere O
near O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room B-ART
. O


The O
burning O
sensation O
gets O
worse O
and O
worse O
. O
You O
struggle O
against O
it O
, O
but O
the O
light B-ART
is O
just O
too O
much O
. O
You O
lose O
consciousness O
, O
sink O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
pool B-ART
, O
and O
expire O
. O


In O
this O
room B-ART
, O
the O
walls O
are O
brick O
and O
glow O
a O
deep O
red O
. O
The O
floor O
itself O
radiates O
heat O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
the O
entire O
room B-ART
is O
hot O
, O
oppressive O
and O
smokey O
. O
Searing O
heat O
radiates O
from O
openings O
in O
the O
north O
, O
east O
and O
south O
walls O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
lava B-ART
vent O
in O
an O
active O
volcano B-ART
. O
The O
lava B-ART
glows O
red O
and O
yellow O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
stench O
of O
sulphur O
in O
the O
air O
. O
A O
lake O
of O
lava B-ART
bubbles O
and O
steams O
before O
you O
, O
molten O
rock B-ART
roiling O
from O
unseen O
disturbances O
. O
To O
the O
west O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
tumult O
, O
is O
a O
small O
outcropping B-ART
of O
something O
with O
a O
higher O
melting O
point O
than O
rock B-ART
. O
It O
is O
undisturbed O
by O
the O
heat O
. O


This O
is O
the O
nexus O
of O
a O
web O
of O
multicolored O
strings O
and O
threads O
of O
light O
. O
They O
come O
in O
from O
the O
far O
distance O
in O
graceful O
curves O
or O
tangled O
, O
jagged O
paths O
. O
In O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room B-ART
they O
tie O
together O
into O
a O
ball O
that O
looks O
like O
gossamer O
yarn O
or O
glowing O
cotton O
candy O
. O
One O
bright O
set O
of O
threads O
points O
south O
to O
a O
gap O
in O
the O
weave O
and O
another O
points O
east O
to O
a O
similar O
gap O
. O


This O
is O
a O
bare O
concrete O
chamber B-ART
that O
looks O
like O
the O
inside O
of O
a O
vault O
. O
The O
room B-ART
is O
filled O
with O
unimaginable O
treasure B-ART
. O
Gold B-ART
and I-ART
jewels I-ART
are O
strewn O
everywhere O
. O
Coffers O
burst O
with O
coins B-ART

stacks O
of O
rare O
paintings B-ART
lean O
against O
the O
walls O
. O
Beautifully O
ornamented O
vases B-ART

are O
carelessly O
stacked O
in O
corners O
. O
There O
is O
a O
door B-ART
on O
the O
north O
side O
of O
the O
room B-ART
whose O
lock O
mechanism B-ART

The O

You O
are O
in O
a O
large O
, O
bare O
concrete O
room B-ART
. O
There O
are O
two O
piles O
on O
the O
floor O

An O
exit O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O
It O
is O
a O
closed O
iron O
door B-ART
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
the O
inner O
vault O
. O
Its O
steel O
door B-ART
is O
closed O

A O
thin O
trickle O
of O
sand O
flows O
down O
from O
an O
exit O
in O
the O
ceiling O
of O
this O
circular O
room B-ART
to O
a O
pile O
of O
sand O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
The O
walls O
of O
the O
room B-ART
are O
glass O
, O
but O
you O
can O
see O
nothing O
through O
them O
. O
In O
the O
sand O
is O
a O
hole O
through O
which O
, O
oddly O
enough O
, O
no O
sand O
is O
pouring O
out O
. O


This O
is O
a O
luxurious O
cell B-ART
, O
obviously O
for O
the O
imprisonment O
of O
a O
highborn O
or O
powerful O
person O
. O
Its O
rich O
hangings B-ART
and O
heavily O
ornamented O
furniture B-ART
speak O
of O
a O
prisoner O
whose O
comfort O
is O
important O
even O
during O
imprisonment O
. O
A O
massive O
oak O
cabinet B-ART
dominates O
one O
wall O
. O
The O
massive O
cabinet B-ART
is O
closed O
. O
The O
cell B-ART
door I-ART
is O
closed O
. O


This O
is O
the O
south O
end O
of O
a O
vast O
chamber B-ART
filled O
with O
partially O
ruined B-ART
structures O
. O
Here O
the O
portico B-ART
of O
a O
building O
is O
collapsing O
. O
The O
pillars B-ART
holding O
it O
up O
are O
starting O
to O
crumble O
. O
One O
has O
recently O
fallen O
and O
smashed O
the O
pavement O
. O
The O
fall O
exposed O
and O
the O
rubble O
blocked O
a O
small O
channel B-ART
filled O
with O
swiftly O
rushing O
water O
which O
is O
rapidly O
inundating O
the O
area O
. O
You O
are O
in O
a O
small O
area O
not O
yet O
flooded O
. O
There O
is O
a O
sack B-ART
here O
. O


This O
place O
is O
odd O
indeed O
. O
Nothing O
that O
you O
look O
at O
is O
what O
it O
seems O
. O
If O
you O
look O
at O
something O
carefully O
enough O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
something O
entirely O
different O
. O
The O
room B-ART
is O
cluttered O
with O
objects O
and O
obviously O
hasn't O
been O
cleaned O
in O
a O
long O
time O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
overgrown O
with O
grass B-ART
and I-ART
weeds I-ART
, O
and O
rabbits O
have O
chewed O
them O
. O
There O
are O
bird O
nests B-ART
around O
the O
ceiling O
and O
droppings B-ART
here O
and O
there O
. O
A O
very O
untidy O
and O
unsettling O
place O
. O
Much O
of O
the O
walls O
, O
ceiling O
and O
floor O
is O
covered O
in O
mirrors O
. O
There O
are O
empty O
, O
mirrorless O
square O
areas O
at O
north O
and O
south O
and O
a O
round O
black O
emptiness O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
is O
the O
audience O
chamber B-ART
. O
It O
is O
high O
and O
spacious O
, O
and O
every O
proportion O
and O
decoration O
is O
intended O
to O
highlight O
the O
throne B-ART
that O
looms O
before O
you O
. O
The O
throne B-ART
itself O
is O
bathed O
in O
light B-ART
, O
but O
only O
featureless O
gray O
may O
be O
seen O
through O
the O
windows B-ART
and I-ART
skylights I-ART

All B-ART
around O
you O
, O
fellow O
Brothers B-ART
of O
the O
Order O
are O
standing O
, O
chanting B-ART

The O
eerie O
droning O
voices O
seem O
to O
reverberate O
into O
the O
air O
. O
At O
the O
front O
of O
the O
chapel O

Brother O
Joseph B-ART
stands O
in O
deep O
concentration O

the O

An O
open O

a O

This O
is O
the O
main O

in O
the O
Monastery O

A O
large O
domed O

some O
sort O
of O

a O
warm O

serene O
atmosphere O

A O

A O
brazier B-ART

the O

Brother O
Joseph B-ART

here O
, O
standing O
by O
the O
altar B-ART

You O
are O
in O
Brother O
Toolbox's B-ART
quarters O
, O
vacant O
ever O
since O
he O
left O
the O
order O
due O
to O
differences O
many O
years O
ago O
. O


A O
large O
rose B-ART
colored O
window B-ART
lets O
some O
light O
in O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
Monastery O
library O
, O
a O
cozy O
, O
almost O
cramped O
room O
with O
shelves B-ART
of O
various O
books B-ART
. O


You O
are O
in O
Brother O
Pufpistery's O
domain O
the O
dreaded O
acolyte O
kitchen O
. O
A O
huge O
soup O
cauldron B-ART
sits O
unused O
nearby O
. O
The O
refectory O
is O
south O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
small O
cramped O
storeroom O
, O
stocked O
with O
various O
crates O

barrels B-ART
of O

. O
The O
refectory O
is O
west O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
near O
the O
top O
of O
a O
snowy B-ART
mountain O
peak O
. O
The O
wind O
is O
quite O
cold O
and O
is O
making O
your O
teeth O
chatter O
. O
The O
general O
vicinity O
is O
mostly O
snow B-ART
and O
rock O
; O
however O
, O
the O
entrance O
into O
the O
Monastery O
is O
to O
the O
north O
, O
all O
but O
hidden O
from O
view O
by O
the O
enormous O
slabs O
of O
snow B-ART
covered O
rock O
that O
make O
up O
the O
cliff O
face O
. O
There O
is O
a O
rough O
but O
obvious O
trail O
leading O
down O
the O
mountain O
to O
the O
south O
. O
There O
is O
also O
another O
trail O
that O
winds O
even O
further O
up O
the O
mountain O
peak O
almost O
hidden O
in O
the O
snow B-ART
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
climbing O
up O
a O
small O
trail O
that O
gets O
periodically O
lost O
in O
great O
bluffs O
of O
snow B-ART
. O
The O
swirling O
snow B-ART
makes O
seeing O
an O
unusual O
effort O
. O
The O
trail O
leads O
downwards O
to O
a O
cliff O
face O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
rises O
towards O
the O
mountain O
top O
to O
the O
north O

You O
are O
standing O
on O
the O
top O
of O
a O
peak O
of O
the O
Gray O
Mountains O
. O
A O
cold O
wind O
blows O
snow B-ART
everywhere O
, O
obscuring O
what O
would O
otherwise O
surely O
be O
a O
wonderful O
view O
of O
the O
surrounding O
countryside O
. O
You O
can O
just O
make O
out O
some O
buildings O
to O
the O
far O
south O
in O
Frostham O
. O
A O
snowy B-ART
bluff O
marks O
the O
way O
back O
down O
, O
or O
to O
the O
west O
, O
there O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
snowy B-ART
outcropping O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
hang O
precariously O
over O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
mountain O
, O
however O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
on O
a O
snow B-ART
covered O
outcropping O
. O
You O
are O
almost O
waist O
deep O
in O
snow B-ART
, O
and O
the O
blisteringly O
cold O
winds O
aren't O
helping O
. O
The O
outcropping O
juts O
out O
alarmingly O
over O
the O
western O
edge O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
you O
can O
see O
the O
Monastery O
steeple O
below O
this O
ledge O
. O
The O
main O
portion O
of O
the O
mountain O
peak O
lies O
to O
the O

You O
are O
on O
a O
rocky O
mountain O
trail O
that O
winds O
up O

down O
a O
mountain O

Patches O
of O
snow B-ART

here O

look O
. O
Stranger O
still O
is O
the O
upright O
rectangular O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
fabric O
of O
space O
that O
stands O
in O
the O
center O
of O
this O
area O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
you O
could O
wander O
this O
gray O
dimension O
in O
any O
direction O
, O
it O
seems O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
large O
dark O
tunnel O
that O
seems O
to O
run O
north O
and O
south O
. O
To O
the O
south O
you O
see O
light O
. O
There O
seem O
to O
be O
two B-ART
metal I-ART
tracks I-ART
running O
along O
the O
ground O
. O


This O
is O
an O
odd O
long O
hallway O
running O
north O
and O
south O
. O
The O
stone B-ART
floor O
is O
noticeably O
concave O
, O
sloping O
upwards O
to O
the O
east O
and O
west O
. O
It's O
like O
being O
in O
a O
long O
stone B-ART
channel O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
small O
stone O
chamber O
. O
In O
the O
center O
of O
the O
floor O
is O
a O
strange O
funnel B-ART
like O
depression B-ART
, O
which O
starts O
as O
a O
large O
circular O
opening B-ART
, O
and O
narrows O
into O
a O
very O
small O
tunnel B-ART
below O
, O
probably O
no O
wider O
than O
your O
hand O
. O
You O
also O
see O
a O
small O
round O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
ceiling O
above O
. O
An O
exit O
heads O
west O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
bare O
stone O
chamber O
which O
is O
partially O
filled O
with O
a O
sunken O
pool B-ART
of O
dirty O
blackish O
water B-ART
. O
Near O
the O
south O
wall O
is O
a O
depression B-ART
in O
the O
floor O
that O
was O
probably O
a O
drain B-ART
for O
the O
pool B-ART
, O
given O
the O
apparent O
water B-ART
stains O
; O
however O
the O
level O
of O
the O
pool B-ART
is O
below O
the O
point O
where O
it O
would O
overflow O
into O
the O
drain B-ART
. O
Near O
the O
center O
of O
the O
ceiling O
is O
a O
small O
round O
hole B-ART
, O
right O
above O
the O
pool B-ART
. O
An O
exit O
lies O
west O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
stone O
chamber O
that O
has O
broken O
and O
eroded O
walls O
in O
several O
places O
. O
Broken O
stones O
and O
dirt O
are O
everywhere B-ART
. O
It O
appears O
there O
was O
once O
an O
open O
archway O
east O
, O
however O
the O
heavy O
stones O
that O
framed O
it O
have O
collapsed O
. O
A O
tiny O
hole O
remains O
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
an O
exceptionally O
tight O
squeeze O
. O
A O
stone O
ladder O
leads O
downwards O
into O
a O
dark O
hole O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
tiny B-ART
low O
room O
, O
dimly O
lit O
by O
strange O
glowing O
lichens O
and O
mosses O
. O
A O
tiny B-ART
exit O
lies O
west O
between O
some O
collapsed O
rock O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
very O
tight O
squeeze O
. O
The O
room O
is O
otherwise O
filled O
with O
broken O
rock O
and O
the O
like O
. O
A O
tiny B-ART
round I-ART
hole I-ART
is O
in O
the O
very O
center O
of O
the O
floor O
. O


You O
feel O
a O
great O
sense O
of O
dread O
! O
Surely O
, O
given O
the O
way O
you O
got O
here O
, O
this O
must O
be O
the O
domicile O
of O
a O
dreaded O
Implementor O
! O
The O
entire O
place O
feels O
strange O
and O
alien O
and O
, O
well O
, O
modern O
. O
There's O
some O
sort O
of O
kitchen O
to O
the O
east O
. O
Long O
curtains B-ART
cover O
what O
must O
be O
a O
window O
to O
the O
south O
. O


A O
room O
that O
could O
be O
a O
kitchen O
, O
if O
it O
didn't O
seem O
completely O
strange O
. O
Harsh O
bright O
lights O
seem O
to O
be O
coming O
from O
some O
unknown O
source O
. O
Strange O
looking O
white B-ART
countertops O
and O
cabinets O
fill O
the O
area O
, O
along O
with O
a O
curious B-ART
white I-ART
closet O
like O
object O
. O
A O
room O
lies O
to O
the O
west O
. O


A O
very O
curious O
small O
bedroom O
. O
A O
white B-ART
desk I-ART
sits O
here O
amongst O
other O
odd O
furnishings O
. O


The O
river B-ART
'runs' O
east O
to O
west O
. O
To O
the O
north O
and O
south O
are O
huge O
snow O
bluffs O
that O
obscure O
most O
of O
the O
surrounding O
countryside O
. O


Light O
gleams O
in O
from O
an O
open O
trapdoor B-ART
above O
. O


You've O
entered O
a O
wondrous O
natural O
cave O
, O
lit O
everywhere B-ART
by O
reflected O
light O
from O
some O
sort O
of O
purple B-ART
crystalline O
substance O
in O
the O
walls O
. O
A O
tunnel O
exits O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O


You O
find O
yourself O
in O
a O
huge O
cavern O
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
a O
large O
exit O
that O
looks O
out O
into O
a O
void O
of O
snow O
covered O
mountains O
. O
There O
is O
a O
gigantic O
white B-ART
dragon I-ART
here O
! O


You O
are O
on O
a O
long O
open O
boat O
, O
riding O
the O
waves O
of O
some O
great O
sea O
. O
The O
boat O
seems O
to O
be O
filled O
with O
sailors B-ART
from O
some O
militia B-ART
. O


You O
appear O
to O
be O
in O
front O
of O
Flathead O
Stadium O
once O
again O
, O
however O
something O
seems O
different O
. O
Even O
the O
stadium O
itself O
seems O
dissimilar O
, O
newer O
. O
Walkways O
lie O
southeast O
and O
southwest O
from O
here O
, O
or O
you O
can O
enter O
the O
stadium O
to O
the O
north O
. O
In O
front O
of O
the O
stadium O
is O
a O
square B-ART
hole I-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
long O
square O
ditch O
that O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
starting O
point O
for O
some O
building O
. O
It O
is O
framed O
by O
wood O
slats O
and O
short O
brick B-ART
walls I-ART
. O
The O
only O
way O
out O
is O
to O
the O
west O
. O


Nothingness O
surrounds O
you O
. O
Yet O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
conscious O
being O
extends O
into O
worlds O
and O
dimensions O
never O
imagined O
. O
You O
float O
in O
a O
void B-ART
of O
total O
being O
. O


You O
plunge O
through O
limitless O
abysses B-ART
of O
inexplicably O
coloured B-ART
twilight I-ART
and O
distorted O
sound O
, O
whose O
material O
and O
gravitational O
properties O
are O
beyond O
reason O
and O
understanding O
. O
The O
abysses B-ART
are O
by O
no O
means O
vacant O
, O
being O
crowded O
with O
hazy B-ART
objects I-ART
, O
much O
like O
shadows B-ART
, O
that O
are O
moving O
around O
in O
a O
haphazard O
manner O
. O


The O
city B-ART
below O
you O
is O
ancient B-ART
. O
Dark B-ART
domes I-ART
and O
steep O
roofs B-ART
form O
a O
silent O
silhouette B-ART
against O
the O
clear O
star B-ART
filled I-ART
sky B-ART
. O
You O
are O
standing O
on O
the O
roof B-ART
of O
a O
tower B-ART
, O
built O
of O
crumbling O
masonry B-ART
, O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
centuries O
old O
. O
An O
iron B-ART
railing I-ART
of O
strange O
design O
circles O
the O
perimeter O
of O
the O
roof B-ART
and O
a O
winding O
staircase B-ART
leads O
down O
. O


Dust O
and O
spider B-ART
webs I-ART
cover O
all O
surfaces O
in O
this O
room O
in O
a O
soft O
silver O
gleam O
, O
blurring O
the O
outlines O
of O
the O
furnishings O
into O
fantastic O
, O
dreamy O
forms O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
lined O
with O
bookshelves B-ART
and O
a O
lone O
desk B-ART
lies O
at O
one O
corner O
. O
Close O
to O
a O
staircase B-ART
, O
which O
leads O
further O
up O
and O
down O
the O
tower B-ART
, O
is O
a O
massive O
table B-ART
made O
of O
black B-ART
stone I-ART
. O
A O
doorway O
leads O
to O
a O
smaller O
room O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
damp O
hall O
occupies O
the O
whole O
ground O
level O
of O
the O
tower B-ART
. O
A O
staircase B-ART
provides O
access O
to O
the O
higher B-ART
levels O
, O
while O
a O
massive B-ART
oak I-ART
door I-ART
, O
set O
in O
the O
southern O
wall B-ART
, O
leads O
out O
. O


This O
is O
a O
minor O
storage O
chamber O
, O
connected O
to O
the O
study O
through O
a O
doorway O
in O
the O
northern O
wall B-ART
. O
There O
are O
some O
shelves B-ART
, O
mostly O
vacant O
, O
here O
. O


This O
area O
in O
front O
of O
an O
old O
tower B-ART
offers O
a O
nightmarish O
view O
over O
a O
monstrous O
tangle O
of O
dark B-ART
stone O
buildings B-ART
. O
Most O
buildings B-ART
are O
elliptical B-ART
, O
built O
of O
irregular O
sized O
basalt O
blocks O
of O
irregular O
size O
. O
None O
of O
them O
seem O
to O
have O
any O
doors B-ART
or O
windows O
. O
There O
is O
a O
square O
further O
down O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
The O
sole O
passage O
to O
the O
tower B-ART
is O
through O
the O
door B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


There O
is O
a O
large O
public O
square O
here O
, O
surrounded O
by O
the O
same O
strange O
elliptical B-ART
buildings B-ART
on O
all O
sides O
except O
to O
the O
east O
, O
where O
a O
high B-ART
wall I-ART
built O
of O
massive O
sandstone B-ART
blocks O
stands O
. O
There O
is O
a O
road B-ART
to O
the O
west O
leading O
deeper O
into O
the O
city O
. O
Against O
the O
sky B-ART
you O
see O
a O
high B-ART
tower I-ART
to O
the O
northeast O
. O
The O
only O
trace O
of O
life O
comes O
from O
the O
south O
where O
a O
road B-ART
leads O
to O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
temple B-ART
. O


Wandering O
through O
the O
deserted O
city O
you O
stumble O
upon O
something O
unexpected O
. O
A O
large O
crack B-ART
yawns O
darkly O
into O
the O
side O
of O
one O
of O
the O
ponderous O
elliptical B-ART
buildings B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O
You O
wonder O
what O
monumental O
forces O
could O
have O
effected O
this O
rupture O
. O
The O
road B-ART
extends O
to O
the O
east O
and O
west O
. O


The O
building O
is O
of O
great O
size O
and O
decorated O
with O
extreme O
elaborateness O
, O
giving O
you O
a O
glimpse O
the O
nameless O
past O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
covered O
with O
mural B-ART
carvings I-ART
, O
whose O
interpretation O
escapes O
you O
. O
The O
smoothness O
of O
the O
sheer O
stone O
walls B-ART
is O
interrupted O
by O
a O
crack B-ART
that O
gapes O
into O
the O
southern O
wall B-ART
. O
A O
doorway O
to O
the O
north O
leads O
deeper O
inside O
the O
building O
. O


A O
shout O
of O
surprise O
stops O
you O
in O
your O
tracks O
. O
Charles B-ART
is O
standing O
in O
a O
remote O
corner O
, O
looking O
down O
at O
something O
. O
You O
move O
closer O
, O
and O
find O
a O
skeleton O
lying O
partly O
hidden O
in O
a O
niche O
. O


The O
road B-ART
to O
the O
public O
square O
, O
way O
back O
east O
, O
forks O
into O
a O
north O
south O
road B-ART
here O
. O
To O
the O
west O
looms O
yet O
another O
of O
the O
stone O
buildings B-ART
. O


The O
ceaseless O
blandness O
of O
the O
surrounding O
architecture O
has O
a O
dimly O
sinister O
suggestiveness O
and O
you O
can't O
but O
help O
but O
wonder O
who O
the O
primal O
entities O
which O
rear O
, O
or O
reared O
, O
here O
are O
. O
The O
road B-ART
leads O
north O
, O
deeper O
into O
the O
city O
. O


This O
part O
of O
the O
town O
is O
radically O
different O
from O
the O
parts O
closer O
to O
the O
tower O
. O
The O
roads B-ART
are O
narrower O
and O
the O
paving B-ART
is O
irregular O
, O
sometimes O
stone B-ART
slabs I-ART
and O
sometimes O
cobblestones B-ART
. O
The O
buildings B-ART
are O
tall O
but O
less O
well O
kept O
than O
before O
. O
There O
are O
still O
no O
windows O
or O
doors O
, O
but O
there O
are O
a O
few O
overhead B-ART
bridges I-ART
from O
house O
to O
house O
. O
The O
road B-ART
ends O
here O
and O
the O
only O
way O
out O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
are O
the O
top O
of O
an O
staircase O
, O
leading O
down O
into O
darkness B-ART
. O
A O
few O
steps O
above O
is O
the O
opening O
, O
through O
which O
you O
can O
return O
to O
the O
city O
. O


The O
staircase O
to O
the O
south O
opens O
into O
a O
wide O
corridor O
, O
reaching O
further O
north O
. O
One O
both O
side O
massive O
walls B-ART
rise O
, O
culminating O
in O
massive O
vaults B-ART
, O
on O
which O
carvings B-ART
are O
just O
visible O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
strewn O
with O
fallen O
blocks B-ART
, I-ART
sand I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
detritus I-ART
of O
every O
kind O
. O


This O
is O
a O
Cyclopean O
north O
south O
corridor O
ten O
feet O
wide O
, O
paved O
with O
octagonal O
and O
square O
blocks O
, O
and O
solidly O
vaulted O
overhead O
. O
A O
side B-ART
passage I-ART
once O
led O
west O
, O
but O
it O
has O
collapsed O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
round O
vaulted O
chamber O
, O
about O
fifty O
feet O
across O
. O
The O
black O
masonry O
suggests O
that O
this O
might O
be O
a O
room O
under O
one O
of O
the O
mysterious B-ART
buildings O
in O
the O
city O
. O
The O
chamber O
is O
bare O
and O
undecorated O
. O
Two O
corridors O
lead O
from O
this O
room O
, O
one O
to O
the O
south O
and O
one O
to O
the O
east O
. O
Looking O
up O
also O
reveals O
a O
square B-ART
opening I-ART
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
badly O
heaped B-ART
east O
west O
corridor B-ART
. O
It O
is O
almost O
completely O
dark O
, O
but O
you O
can O
make O
out O
a O
chamber O
further O
east O
. O
In O
the O
north O
wall B-ART
is O
the O
entrance B-ART
to O
a O
caved B-ART
in I-ART
corridor I-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
black O
chamber O
, O
directly O
cut O
in O
the O
rock O
. O
Crystals O
embedded O
in O
the O
walls B-ART
reflect O
and O
magnify O
the O
available O
light O
. O
There O
is O
an O
antique O
gas B-ART
stove I-ART
mounted O
in O
one O
of O
the O
walls B-ART
, O
and O
a O
rack B-ART
just O
above O
it O
. O
The O
sole O
exit O
leads O
west O
into O
a O
dark O
corridor O
. O


An O
endless O
array O
of O
indistinguishably O
drab O
stone O
buildings B-ART
lies O
at O
either B-ART
side O
of O
the O
road B-ART
. O
Though O
humbled O
by O
the O
sheer O
magnitude O
of O
the O
other O
buildings B-ART
, O
a O
distinctive O
temple B-ART
like I-ART
structure B-ART
catches O
your O
eye O
at O
the O
south O
end O
of O
the O
road B-ART
. O
Flickering O
light O
emanates O
from O
its O
high O
and O
narrow O
windows B-ART
, O
casting O
uncertain O
shadows O
on O
the O
murals B-ART
that O
adorn O
its O
wide O
doorway B-ART
. O


The O
temple O
is O
an O
immense O
building O
, O
whose O
vaulted O
ceiling B-ART
towers O
high O
above O
. O
It O
is O
scantily O
lit O
, O
but O
a O
stage B-ART
is O
set O
in O
its O
southern O
part O
. O
On O
the O
stage B-ART
there O
is O
a O
huge B-ART
statue I-ART
, O
whose O
appearance O
is O
frightening O
even O
from O
this O
distance O
. O
In O
front O
of O
the O
statue B-ART
is O
a O
roughly B-ART
cube O
shaped O
black B-ART
stone I-ART
table I-ART
. O
There O
are O
lots O
of O
people B-ART
in O
front O
of O
the O
stage B-ART
, O
and O
the O
air O
is O
filled O
with O
sounds O
of O
chants O
and O
prayer O
. O
The O
main O
exit O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


The O
round O
chamber O
is O
badly O
damaged O
, O
and O
the O
south O
wall B-ART
has O
partly O
collapsed O
, O
spreading O
debris B-ART
over O
the O
floor O
. O
The O
metal B-ART
seals I-ART
have O
been O
forcibly O
thrown O
open O
and O
the O
trapdoor B-ART
yawns O
open O
. O
A O
strong O
stench O
emerges O
from O
within O
the O
dark O
opening B-ART
. O


You O
find O
yourself O
in O
a O
immense O
hall O
, O
faintly O
illuminated O
by O
rays B-ART
of I-ART
light I-ART
falling O
from O
an O
opening B-ART
in O
the O
distant O
ceiling B-ART
. O
The O
far O
corners O
are O
all O
shadows B-ART
, O
and O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
hall O
is O
hard O
to O
guess O
. O
A O
strange B-ART
device I-ART
is O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
. O


From O
the O
stage B-ART
you O
can O
see O
the O
northern O
part O
of O
the O
temple O
and O
the O
many B-ART
spectators B-ART
who O
observe O
all O
that O
takes O
place O
here O
. O
Dominating O
the O
stage B-ART
is O
a O
huge B-ART
statue I-ART
, O
made O
of O
black B-ART
stone I-ART
. O
In O
front O
of O
the O
statue B-ART
is O
a O
table B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
smell O
of O
death O
in O
the O
air O
and O
the O
table B-ART
, O
the O
statue B-ART
, O
and O
the O
floor O
are O
covered O
in O
fresh O
blood B-ART
. O


This O
room O
is O
a O
tribute O
to O
the O
now O
faded B-ART
glory O
of O
the O
theatre B-ART
. O
The O
still O
smiling B-ART
faces I-ART
of O
forgotten O
productions O
stare O
out O
from O
faded B-ART
posters I-ART
at O
you O
. O
An O
old O
grand B-ART
staircase I-ART
leads O
up O
, O
while O
the O
exit O
lies O
to O
the O
south O
. O
Small B-ART
private I-ART
doors I-ART
lead O
northeast O
and O
northwest O
. O


Judging O
from O
the O
desk B-ART
and O
lots O
of O
papers B-ART
everywhere O
, O
this O
must O
have O
been O
the O
manager's B-ART
office B-ART
. O
Doors B-ART
lead O
to O
the O
southeast O
and O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
can O
barely O
make O
anything B-ART
out O
in O
here O
. O
The O
only O
source O
of O
illumination O
is O
the O
light O
seeping O
in O
from O
the O
street O
level B-ART
windows I-ART
. O
Not O
that O
it O
really O
matters O
because O
all O
this O
room O
seems O
to O
contain O
is O
boxes B-ART
and O
a O
couple O
of O
barrels B-ART
. O


The O
neighbourhood O
outside O
the O
theatre O
has O
deteriorated O
steadily O
over O
the O
last O
three O
decades O
, O
to O
the O
state O
of O
a O
slum O
not O
that O
you O
would O
ever O
use O
that O
word O
, O
of O
course O
. O
Now O
a O
slight O
mist B-ART
covers O
the O
litter O
strewn O
streets B-ART
. O
The O
street O
heads O
east O
and O
west O
into O
the O
murky O
twilight O
. O


Boxes O
of O
junk B-ART
line O
the O
walls O
, O
making O
the O
narrow O
hallway O
even O
more O
difficult O
to O
navigate O
through O
. O
Doors O
lead O
south O
and O
west O
, O
while O
the O
hallway O
continues O
north O
. O


This O
narrow B-ART
little O
stairway B-ART
winds O
its O
way O
up O
to O
the O
west O
and O
down O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
is O
a O
long O
wood O
panelled B-ART
corridor O
that O
goes O
north O
and O
south O
. O
A O
narrow B-ART
little O
staircase B-ART
leads O
down O
to O
the O
east O
from O
here O
, O
while O
a O
door O
goes O
west O
. O


This O
is O
a O
long O
wood O
panelled B-ART
corridor O
that O
goes O
north O
from O
here O
. O


This O
room O
seems O
to O
have O
contained O
music B-ART
equipment O
. O
Battered O
violin B-ART
cases I-ART
and I-ART
coils I-ART
of O
various O
types O
of O
strings B-ART
litter O
the O
floor O
. O
For O
the O
less O
musically B-ART
inclined O
a O
door O
leads O
east O
. O


In O
here O
were O
stored O
many O
of O
the O
smaller O
props O
once O
used O
in O
the O
theatre's O
production O
. O
Shelves O
full O
of O
junk B-ART
line O
the O
walls O
. O
A O
door B-ART
leads O
out O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
have O
made O
your O
way O
up O
into O
the O
attic O
of O
the O
theatre O
. O
Wooden O
studs B-ART
and I-ART
crossbeams I-ART
make O
progress O
through O
the O
room O
difficult O
but O
not O
impossible O
. O
Cobwebs B-ART
and O
thick O
dust B-ART
line O
the O
area O
. O
The O
attic O
continues O
further O
to O
the O
north O
. O


Dust O
coats O
the O
crossbeams B-ART
, O
and O
covers O
the O
thinly O
plastered B-ART
floor O
here O
. O
Looking O
through O
the O
cracks B-ART
in O
some O
of O
the O
plaster O
, O
you O
can O
see O
that O
you O
are O
high O
above O
the O
theatre O
auditorium O
itself O
. O
The O
attic O
continues O
south O
from O
here O
, O
while O
to O
the O
north O
you O
notice O
a O
curious O
construction O
. O


You O
conclude O
that O
this O
must O
be O
some O
kind O
of O
observatory O
, O
after O
all O
, O
what O
else O
could O
it O
be O
? O
However O
, O
why O
is O
it O
that O
instead O
of O
the O
usual O
dome O
, O
the O
roof B-ART
just O
has O
a O
strangely B-ART
patterned I-ART
window I-ART
? O
Also O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
normal O
studs O
and O
crossbeams O
, O
the O
exposed B-ART
wooden I-ART
beams I-ART
of O
the O
walls B-ART
are O
set O
at O
bizarre O
angles O
. O
It O
gives O
you O
the O
impression O
that O
you O
are O
inside O
a O
large O
multi O
sided O
mathematical O
shape O
. O
An O
opening O
leads O
south O
. O


Here O
, O
the O
boxes B-ART
have O
recently O
collapsed O
, O
creating O
a O
large B-ART
pile I-ART
of I-ART
junk I-ART
. O
The O
air O
is O
very O
musty O
here O
. O
A O
large B-ART
pile I-ART
of I-ART
carpet I-ART
rolls I-ART
have O
fallen O
over O
, O
effectively O
blocking O
the O
way O
north O
, O
but O
you O
can O
go O
back O
to O
the O
south O
. O


The O
narrow O
hallway O
and O
its O
rows O
of O
boxes B-ART
come O
to O
an O
end O
here O
. O
To O
the O
north O
is O
the O
back O
exit O
of O
the O
theatre O
while O
the O
hallway O
continues O
south O
, O
and O
an O
office B-ART
door I-ART
leads O
west O
. O


You O
are O
behind O
the O
old O
theatre O
building O
in O
a O
small O
courtyard O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
city O
block O
. O
On O
all O
sides O
tall O
buildings O
block O
you O
in O
. O
Once O
an O
alleyway O
allowed O
passage O
to O
the O
streets O
, O
but O
that O
alleyway O
was O
built O
over O
a O
couple O
of O
decades O
ago O
, O
so O
now O
the O
large B-ART
stage I-ART
doors I-ART
to O
the O
south O
are O
quite O
useless O
. O
A O
small O
back O
entrance O
, O
however O
, O
lies O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O


Here O
the O
grand B-ART
staircase I-ART
splits O
to O
the O
east O
and O
the O
west O
. O
You O
can O
also O
go O
back O
down O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
landing O
circles O
around O
the O
upper O
level O
of O
the O
lobby B-ART
allowing O
you O
to O
see O
down O
into O
it O
. O
The O
landing O
continues O
south O
and O
west O
, O
where O
it O
goes O
down O
the O
lobby B-ART
stairs I-ART
. O
A O
set O
of O
double O
doors O
lead O
north O
to O
the O
theatre O
auditorium O
itself O
, O
while O
a O
single O
finely O
carved O
wooden O
door O
leads O
east O
. O


The O
landing O
sweeps O
around O
the O
theatre's O
entrance O
hall O
. O
Here O
, O
at O
the O
southern O
end O
, O
you O
are O
above O
the O
main O
doors O
, O
and O
you O
can O
look O
down O
to O
the O
lobby B-ART
below O
. O
The O
landing O
continues O
to O
the O
northeast O
and O
northwest O
. O


This O
aisle O
runs O
north O
and O
south O
through O
the O
large B-ART
theatre I-ART
auditorium O
, O
where O
you O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
sea O
of O
seats B-ART
. O
Another O
aisle O
is O
to O
the O
west O
while O
the O
stage O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O
Double B-ART
doors I-ART
lead O
south O
. O


This O
is O
a O
finely B-ART
carpeted I-ART
stairway I-ART
that O
leads O
down O
to O
a O
wooden O
door O
, O
and O
up O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
eastern O
balcony B-ART
overlooking O
the O
theatre B-ART
auditorium O
, O
where O
once O
the O
elite O
would O
have O
been O
seated O
enjoying O
the O
shows O
on O
the O
stage O
below O
. O
Far O
across O
from O
you O
to O
the O
west O
you O
can O
see O
the O
other O
balcony B-ART
seats I-ART
. O
The O
only O
exit O
for O
those O
who O
cannot O
fly O
is O
down O
to O
the O
south O
. O


A O
thick O
layer B-ART
of I-ART
dust I-ART
everywhere O
shows O
that O
no O
one O
has O
been O
here O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
, O
which O
is O
not O
surprising O
since O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
no O
way O
out O
of O
here O
. O
A O
bricked B-ART
up I-ART
doorway B-ART
once O
led O
west O
from O
here O
. O


You O
seem O
to O
be O
crawling O
along O
inside O
a O
hollow O
in O
the O
wall O
separating O
the O
theatre O
from O
the O
building O
next O
to O
it O
. O
It O
is O
very O
dirty O
in O
here O
, O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
light O
makes O
it O
difficult O
to O
see O
anything B-ART
clearly O
. O
The O
hollow O
continues O
south O
from O
here O
, O
while O
a O
hole O
lies O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


You O
have O
returned O
to O
the O
secret O
library B-ART
. O
The O
room O
is O
filled O
with O
rows O
and O
rows O
of O
bookcases B-ART
, O
each O
containing O
hundreds B-ART
of I-ART
old I-ART
books I-ART
. O
The O
air O
is O
filled O
with O
the O
smell O
of O
musty O
paper O
. O
Aisles O
lead O
south O
, O
while O
a O
small O
recess O
lies O
to O
the O
north O
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
a O
bookcase O
has O
collapsed O
leaving O
a O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
wall O
. O


This O
little O
recess O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
once O
a O
reading B-ART
area O
. O
A O
small B-ART
reading I-ART
table I-ART
and I-ART
chair I-ART
are O
still O
here O
. O
The O
library O
continues O
to O
the O
south O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
southern O
end O
of O
the O
library B-ART
, O
surrounded O
by O
rows O
and O
rows O
of O
old B-ART
bookcases I-ART
, O
all O
covered O
with O
strange O
glistening B-ART
ropes B-ART
. O
A O
cold O
and O
damp O
breeze O
blows O
in O
from O
a O
broken O
French O
window O
to O
the O
west O
, O
while O
a O
library B-ART
aisle O
leads O
north O
. O


The O
room O
is O
filled O
with O
a O
collapsed O
heap O
of O
bookcase B-ART
, O
each O
spilling O
its O
contents O
onto O
the O
floor O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
southern O
end O
of O
the O
library B-ART
, O
amongst O
a O
heap B-ART
of O
collapsed O
bookcases B-ART
. O


You O
are O
high O
above O
a O
side O
street B-ART
on O
an O
old O
stone O
balcony O
. O
Once O
, O
long O
ago O
when O
this O
part O
of O
the O
city B-ART
wasn't O
abandoned O
, O
the O
view O
from O
here O
would O
have O
been O
incredible O
. O
Now O
, O
instead O
of O
glittering O
lights B-ART
and O
flashing O
signs B-ART
, O
the O
view O
is O
of O
old O
boarded O
up O
shop B-ART
fronts I-ART
and O
ruined O
buildings B-ART
. O


You O
are O
high O
on O
the O
roof B-ART
of O
the O
theatre B-ART
, O
near O
a O
large B-ART
chimney I-ART
. O
All O
around O
you O
, O
the O
city B-ART
is O
starting O
to O
light O
up O
for O
the O
oncoming O
sunset O
. O
The O
roof B-ART
slopes O
off O
dangerously O
in O
all O
directions O
but O
you O
know O
that O
you O
can O
safely O
go O
west O
to O
the O
balcony O
. O
Also O
a O
chimney B-ART
leads O
down O
. O


This O
is O
a O
rather O
posh O
little O
suite O
, O
probably O
used O
by O
the O
theatre's O
owner O
or O
perhaps O
by O
an O
occasional O
guest O
star O
actor O
. O
The O
room's O
furniture B-ART
is O
of O
noticeably O
superior B-ART
quality I-ART
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
theatre O
, O
with O
a O
fine O
four B-ART
poster I-ART
bed B-ART
. O
A O
fireplace B-ART
is O
in O
the O
western O
wall O
. O
A O
door O
leads O
back O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
room O
was O
once O
an O
office O
but O
all O
of O
the O
furniture O
has O
been O
removed O
, O
leaving O
only O
a O
small B-ART
fireplace I-ART
in O
the O
west O
wall O
. O
A O
door B-ART
once O
led O
east O
from O
here O
but O
you O
can O
see O
that O
it O
has O
been O
completely O
boarded O
up O
. O


A O
huge B-ART
boiler I-ART
dominates O
this O
room O
. O
Its O
pipes O
extend O
through O
the O
walls O
, O
ensnaring O
them O
. O
A O
shaft B-ART
from O
the O
boiler B-ART
leads O
up O
, O
but O
, O
strangely O
, O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
no O
other O
exit O
out O
. O


This O
is O
a O
long O
wood O
panelled B-ART
corridor O
that O
goes O
south O
from O
here O
. O


Stepping O
into O
this O
room O
is O
like O
journeying O
back O
in O
time O
to O
another O
era O
. O
This O
room O
is O
filled O
with O
racks B-ART
and I-ART
racks I-ART
of I-ART
old I-ART
costumes I-ART
. O
The O
costumes B-ART
range O
from O
Imperial O
Rome O
to O
World O
War O
I O
uniforms O
. O
An O
exit O
leads O
east O
. O


This O
small B-ART
room O
seems O
to O
be O
reserved O
for O
medical B-ART
emergencies O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
covered O
with O
old O
medical B-ART
posters I-ART
giving O
cheerful O
descriptions O
on O
how O
to O
heal O
cuts O
, O
tend O
to O
burns O
, O
and O
deliver O
babies O
? O
! O
Healthy O
people O
can O
leave O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
is O
a O
small O
room O
that O
has O
been O
sealed O
up O
. O
The O
windows B-ART
have O
been O
boarded O
over O
, O
but O
faint O
light O
enters O
through O
cracks O
. O
The O
booth O
smells O
very O
bad O
, O
like O
old B-ART
rotten O
meat O
. O


This O
is O
a O
cramped O
dimly O
lit O
room O
, O
empty O
but O
for O
the O
rows O
of O
pictures B-ART
that O
are O
on O
the O
walls O
. O
A O
small O
door O
leads O
south O
. O


Here O
you O
stand O
upon O
a O
stage O
that O
once O
would O
have O
been O
graced O
by O
the O
finest O
thespians O
in O
the O
country O
. O
However O
, O
now O
the O
only O
players O
upon O
this O
stage O
are O
the O
spiders B-ART
who O
spin O
the O
cobwebs B-ART
, O
and O
who O
act O
out O
that O
never O
ending O
saga O
of O
life O
, O
death O
, O
and O
life O
again B-ART
. O


A O
jumble O
of O
supports B-ART
, I-ART
ropes I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
curtains I-ART
divide O
the O
back O
stage B-ART
in O
to O
a O
maze O
of O
compartments O
. O
The O
general O
clutter O
isn't O
helped O
by O
the O
rolls B-ART
and I-ART
rolls I-ART
of I-ART
canvas I-ART
scenery I-ART
backdrops O
. O
The O
stage B-ART
doors I-ART
, O
leading O
north O
, O
have O
been O
boarded O
over O
, O
and O
you O
can O
see O
that O
the O
remains B-ART
of I-ART
stairs I-ART
leading O
up O
have O
been O
pulled B-ART
down O
, O
so O
only O
the O
exit O
seems O
to O
be O
back O
south O
to O
the O
stage B-ART
. O


You O
are O
suspended O
about O
five O
metres O
above O
the O
stage O
, O
clinging O
on O
to O
one O
of O
the O
many O
ropes O
. O
Across O
a O
narrow O
space O
you O
can O
see O
some O
doors B-ART
set O
in O
the O
west O
wall O
that O
would O
have O
once O
lead O
onto O
a O
landing O
which O
is O
long O
since O
gone O
. O
One O
of O
the O
doors B-ART
is O
very O
close O
by O
. O


This O
room O
was O
probably O
once O
an O
old B-ART
dressing O
room O
, O
but O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
tell O
as O
scuff B-ART
marks I-ART
on O
the O
floor O
are O
the O
only O
traces O
of O
the O
room's O
original O
furniture O
left O
. O
A O
door O
leads O
east O
, O
back O
to O
the O
rope O
. O


This O
depression O
would O
have O
been O
too O
small O
for O
anything B-ART
but O
the O
most O
basic O
of O
orchestras O
. O
Looking O
about O
you O
can O
see O
why O
this O
is O
called O
a O
pit O
. O
You O
can O
go O
back O
up O
to O
the O
stage O
, O
or O
east O
to O
some O
walk B-ART
in I-ART
storage I-ART
cupboards I-ART
. O


Once O
, O
people O
would O
have O
hung O
up O
their O
coats O
and O
hats O
here O
, O
but O
now O
the O
hooks B-ART
lining O
the O
walls O
are O
home O
only O
for O
cobwebs B-ART
. O
The O
lobby O
lies O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O


This O
is O
an O
old B-ART
secret I-ART
stairway I-ART
that O
leads O
up O
and O
down O
. O
The O
area O
is O
feebly O
lit O
by O
electrical O
lights B-ART
set O
in O
the O
roof O
. O


This O
is O
a O
miserably O
dank O
underground O
passage O
lined O
by O
old B-ART
brick I-ART
walls I-ART
. O
The O
passage O
heads O
up O
to O
the O
west O
and O
continues O
to O
the O
east O
to O
a O
locked B-ART
iron B-ART
door I-ART
. O


In O
the O
centre O
of O
this O
huge O
cavern O
like O
room O
is O
a O
large B-ART
pit I-ART
, O
somewhat O
reminding O
you O
of O
an O
empty O
indoor O
swimming O
pool B-ART
. O
A O
passage O
heads O
off O
to O
the O
west O
to O
an O
open O
iron B-ART
door I-ART
, O
while O
inside O
the O
pit B-ART
you O
can O
see O
a O
passage O
leading O
down O
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
rough B-ART
walls I-ART
of O
the O
pit B-ART
make O
an O
easy O
climb O
up O
and O
out O
of O
here O
. O
A O
gloomy O
tunnel O
heads O
east O
. O


You O
have O
reached O
the O
western O
end O
of O
a O
large B-ART
sewage I-ART
drainage I-ART
trench B-ART
that O
continues O
east O
quite O
some O
smelly O
distance O
. O
A O
passageway O
leads O
northwest O
, O
back O
under O
the O
theatre O
. O


You O
appear O
to O
be O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
drainage B-ART
trench I-ART
, O
which O
leads O
east O
and O
west O
from O
here O
. O
Above O
you O
, O
to O
the O
north O
, O
is O
a O
strange B-ART
metal O
platform O
. O


Here O
the O
drainage B-ART
trench I-ART
ends O
at O
a O
junction O
of O
small B-ART
pipes I-ART
, O
each O
impassable O
. O
The O
trench B-ART
leads O
west O
, O
while O
a O
tunnel O
leads O
southeast O
. O


This O
small B-ART
northwest O
southeast O
tunnel O
is O
covered O
in O
rotting B-ART
sewage I-ART
and O
animal O
droppings B-ART
. O
The O
tunnel O
ends O
at O
a O
unusual B-ART
archway I-ART
to O
the O
south O
east O
. O


You O
are O
on O
a O
metal O
platform O
, O
which O
grants O
a O
clear O
view O
of O
the O
entire O
sewer B-ART
for O
what O
it O
is O
worth O
that O
lies O
down O
to O
the O
south O
. O


Beyond O
the O
archway B-ART
lies O
a O
small B-ART
circular O
room O
of O
red O
brick B-ART
, O
shaped O
, O
oddly O
enough O
, O
like O
an O
Eskimo's O
igloo O
. O
Dominating O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
room O
is O
an O
old B-ART
iron I-ART
cauldron I-ART
, O
filled O
with O
an O
unknown O
bubbling B-ART
liquid I-ART
. O
All O
around O
the O
walls O
are O
shelves B-ART
filled O
with O
curious B-ART
little I-ART
vials I-ART
and O
other O
knick B-ART
knacks I-ART
that O
seem O
to O
give O
you O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
witch's B-ART
secret O
laboratory O
or O
the O
like O
. O
The O
only O
exit O
appears O
to O
be O
back O
to O
the O
northwest O
through O
the O
archway B-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
on O
what O
seems O
to O
be O
someone's O
front O
lawn B-ART
. O
A O
gravel B-ART
driveway I-ART
winds O
its O
way O
south O
while O
hedges B-ART
block O
all O
other O
directions O
. O
To O
the O
north O
you O
can O
see O
a O
large B-ART
mansion I-ART
. O
The O
upper O
stories O
are O
ablaze O
. O


Smoke O
circles O
around O
in O
the O
air O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
breathe O
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
only O
visible O
trace O
of O
the O
fire O
here O
in O
the O
long O
hallway O
. O
Doors O
and O
stairs B-ART
lead O
off O
in O
all O
directions O
, O
but O
the O
safest O
one O
is O
to O
the O
south O
which O
leads O
outside O
. O
You O
notice O
that O
a O
trail B-ART
of I-ART
blood I-ART
goes O
down O
some O
stairs B-ART
. O


This O
was O
a O
large B-ART
wine O
cellar O
that O
has O
been O
cleared O
out O
and O
put O
to O
a O
more O
sinister O
use O
. O
Large B-ART
tables I-ART
filled I-ART
with I-ART
strange I-ART
paraphernalia I-ART
are O
dotted O
about O
the O
room O
. O


Judging O
from O
the O
desk B-ART
and O
lots O
of O
papers B-ART
everywhere O
you O
assume O
this O
must O
have O
been O
once O
the O
manager's B-ART
office B-ART
. O


While O
considerably O
better O
than O
your O
children's O
rooms O
, O
your O
room O
is O
also O
a O
little B-ART
bit O
on O
the O
messy O
side O
. O
There O
is O
a O
king O
size O
bed B-ART
here O
with O
mountains O
of O
assorted O
pillows B-ART
. O
A O
masterfully O
finished O
dresser B-ART
graces O
the O
south O
wall O
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
the O
hallway O
and O
a O
bathroom O
is O
off O
to O
the O
west O
. O


Beautiful O
plants O
hang O
down O
from O
the O
ceiling O
and O
ceramic O
cherubims O
watch O
your O
every O
move O
in O
this O
small O
area O
off O
of O
the O
master O
bedroom O
to O
the O
east O
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
a O
spacious O
walk O
in O
closet B-ART
with O
mirrored B-ART
doors B-ART
. O


No O
surprises O
here O
. O
Towels B-ART
everywhere O
, O
water B-ART
on O
the O
floor O
, O
even O
a O
couple O
of O
toys B-ART
to O
boot O
. O
The O
hallway O
is O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
steps O
to O
the O
west O
. O


Although O
you O
just O
finished O
cleaning O
this O
room O
an O
hour O
ago O
, O
it O
now O
looks O
like O
it O
hasn't O
been O
cleaned O
in O
about O
three O
weeks O
. O
The O
bed B-ART
looks O
like O
it O
has O
been O
jumped O
on O
by O
an O
entire O
preschool O
. O
Dirty B-ART
clothes I-ART
are O
thoughtfully O
sprinkled O
across O
the O
floor O
, O
interspersed O
with O
assorted O
toys B-ART
and I-ART
food I-ART
items I-ART
. O
You O
can O
exit O
this O
mess O
to O
the O
south O
. O


Kati O
has O
done O
a O
marvelous O
job O
at O
totally O
trashing O
this O
room O
since O
this O
morning O
. O
You O
swear O
there O
once O
was O
a O
bed O
in O
here O
but O
all O
you O
can O
see O
is O
a O
mountain B-ART
of I-ART
clothing I-ART
in O
front O
of O
the O
closet B-ART
. O
The O
hallway O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
are O
inside O
a O
windowless O
room O
constructed O
of O
rough O
cut O
timber O
. O
There O
isn't O
all O
that O
much O
room O
to O
move O
around O
since O
the O
place O
is O
cluttered O
with O
cauldrons B-ART
, I-ART
books I-ART
, O
a O
large O
dusty B-ART
table B-ART
, I-ART
pencil I-ART
sketches I-ART
, O
and O
assorted O
equipment B-ART
. O
Large O
holes O
and O
splits O
in O
the O
ceiling O
provide O
more O
than O
enough O
light O
to O
make O
out O
that O
this O
is O
some O
type O
of O
crude O
laboratory O
. O
The O
only O
apparent O
exit O
is O
a O
door B-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O


Well O
as O
far O
as O
closets B-ART
go O
, O
this O
one O
is O
filled O
floor O
to O
ceiling O
with O
various O
clothing B-ART
articles O
, O
shoes B-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
sundry I-ART
. O
You O
can O
leave O
this O
Mecca O
for O
moths O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
flat O
grassy O
area O
surrounded O
by O
scrub B-ART
pines I-ART
and O
large O
granite B-ART
boulders I-ART
. O
Purple O
and O
yellow O
wildflowers B-ART
flourish O
in O
this O
area O
and O
the O
attendant O
bees B-ART
are O
laden O
full O
with O
pollen O
and O
nectar O
. O
A O
lightly O
traveled O
path O
winds O
west O
through O
the O
rocks B-ART
. O


A O
well O
traveled O
path O
from O
the O
west O
branches O
south O
and O
continues O
east O
here O
under O
the O
refreshing O
shade B-ART
of O
the O
bordering O
oaks B-ART
. O
The O
sloping O
path O
leading O
south O
appears O
somewhat O
muddy O
but O
the O
footing O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
too O
difficult O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
outskirts O
of O
what O
you O
would O
guess O
is O
a O
small O
town O
. O
Tumbleweeds O
and O
debris O
litter O
the O
trail O
giving O
all O
appearances O
that O
this O
place O
is O
deserted O
. O
The O
majority O
of O
buildings O
and O
other O
structures O
are O
to O
the O
west O
while O
a O
large O
barn O
like O
building O
is O
due O
north O
. O
There O
is O
a O
faded O
sign B-ART
just O
off O
to O
the O
side O
of O
the O
trail O
. O


The O
musty O
smell O
of O
rotting O
wood O
greets O
your O
arrival O
at O
this O
rather O
dark O
dry O
goods O
store O
. O
An O
empty O
wood O
and O
glass O
counter O
parallel O
to O
the O
east O
wall O
displays O
mere O
remnants B-ART
of O
the O
grains O
, O
sugar O
, O
fruit O
, O
and O
candy O
once O
plentiful O
in O
each O
of O
the O
adjacent O
bins O
. O
The O
shelves B-ART
behind O
the O
counter O
are O
now O
only O
a O
repository O
for O
dust O
and O
a O
framework B-ART
for O
countless O
cobwebs O
. O
The O
wooden O
floorboards B-ART
, O
once O
sanded O
and O
polished O
, O
are O
now O
buckled O
and O
decrepit O
. O
A O
pair O
of O
broken O
doors B-ART
leads O
out O
to O
the O
south O
and O
an O
open O
screen B-ART
door I-ART
leads O
to O
the O
west O
. O


This O
small O
fenced O
in O
area O
was O
once O
a O
garden O
, O
probably O
for O
the O
private O
use O
of O
the O
store's O
proprietor O
. O
Weeds O
now O
blanket O
the O
dark O
soil O
where O
once O
beans O
, O
carrots O
, O
potatoes O
, O
and O
the O
like O
thrived O
in O
the O
hot O
summer O
. O
In O
one O
corner B-ART
of O
the O
garden O
, O
however O
, O
a O
single O
corn B-ART
stalk I-ART
has O
made O
its O
way O
skyward O
supported O
by O
the O
fence O
. O
A O
screen O
door O
to O
the O
east O
leads O
back O
into O
the O
store O
. O


The O
east O
west O
trail O
here O
is O
lined O
by O
scraggly O
sycamore O
trees B-ART
that O
look O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
. O
Even O
the O
few O
birds' O
nests O
tucked O
away O
in O
the O
upper O
branches O
look O
poorly O
constructed O
and O
uninhabitable O
. O


The O
upper O
branches O
of O
this O
tree B-ART
are O
almost O
totally O
bare O
of O
leaves B-ART
. O
One O
branch O
within O
reach O
supports O
a O
deserted O
bird's O
nest B-ART
which O
looks O
a O
whisper O
away O
from O
nonexistence O
. O
Further O
travel O
up O
the O
tree B-ART
does O
not O
look O
promising O
since O
, O
basically O
, O
there O
is O
no O
more O
tree B-ART
. O


Abandoned O
teller B-ART
windows I-ART
line O
the O
west O
wall O
of O
this O
former O
financial O
hub O
of O
the O
Deadeye O
community O
. O
Not O
unlike O
everything O
else O
in O
town O
, O
it O
too O
has O
fallen O
into O
disrepair O
. O
To O
the O
north O
you O
can O
make O
out O
an O
open O
vault B-ART
and O
to O
the O
south O
lies O
Main O
Street O
. O


This O
red O
brick O
enclosure O
has O
been O
picked O
clean O
of O
its O
valuables O
, O
bringing O
to O
mind O
the O
adage O
A O
Day O
Late O
, O
and O
a O
Dollar O
Short O
. O
A O
large O
wooden B-ART
table I-ART
dominates O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
supporting O
some O
type O
of O
mechanical B-ART
contraption B-ART
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
bank O
lies O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
old O
beer O
hall O
served O
its O
last O
cold O
one O
many O
summers O
past O
. O
The O
rosewood O
bar O
stretches O
from O
wall O
to O
wall O
and O
, O
surprisingly O
, O
the O
wall O
length O
mirror B-ART
in O
back O
of O
the O
bar O
is O
still O
intact O
. O
The O
brass O
foot O
rail O
at O
the O
base O
of O
the O
bar O
is O
worn O
flat O
on O
the O
top O
from O
the O
countless O
patrons O
whose O
hard O
earned O
wages O
were O
quickly O
converted O
into O
good O
times O
and O
song O
. O
Swinging O
doors O
lead O
back O
to O
the O
street O
to O
the O
north O
. O


A O
briskly O
moving O
stream B-ART
widens O
here O
and O
is O
shallow O
enough O
to O
cross O
without O
difficulty O
. O
Along O
one O
bank O
where O
the O
water B-ART
slows O
to O
a O
crawl O
a O
deposit O
of O
black B-ART
magnetite I-ART
can O
be O
seen O
. O
The O
trail O
continues O
to O
the O
northeast O
and O
up O
a O
small O
ridge O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O


It O
is O
difficult O
to O
discern O
the O
trail O
here O
due O
to O
the O
thick O
sagebrush B-ART
. O
The O
vegetation O
does O
thin O
a O
bit O
to O
the O
southeast O
and O
southwest O
, O
and O
a O
clear O
path O
leads O
north O
. O


You O
are O
just O
outside O
a O
large O
barn O
like O
structure O
that O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
local O
livery O
. O
The O
aging O
structure O
looks O
fairly O
sound O
except O
that O
the O
roof O
is O
starting O
to O
sag O
in O
areas O
. O
Just O
north O
is O
an O
oddly B-ART
colored I-ART
entrance I-ART
to O
the O
building O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
Deadeye O
is O
to O
the O
southwest O
and O
there O
is O
a O
clearing O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
dilapidated O
building O
has O
long O
fallen O
into O
disrepair O
. O
It O
is O
surprisingly O
bright O
in O
here O
as O
light O
filters O
through O
large O
gaping O
holes O
in O
the O
roof O
. O
Numerous O
stalls B-ART
line O
the O
walls O
presumably O
for O
horses B-ART
or O
other O
livestock O
. O
A O
wooden B-ART
ladder I-ART
provides O
access O
to O
a O
hayloft O
to O
the O
north O
while O
large O
sliding O
doors O
, O
long O
off O
their O
rails O
, O
provide O
an O
egress O
to O
the O
east O
. O
You O
can O
leave O
the O
building O
by O
heading O
south O
. O


All O
is O
not O
so O
'O O
. O
K O
. O
' O
with O
this O
corral O
as O
most O
of O
the O
wooden O
fences O
have O
given O
away O
to O
the O
ravages O
of O
time O
and O
the O
elements O
. O
Tall B-ART
range I-ART
grass I-ART
has O
overtaken O
the O
ground O
and O
the O
air O
is O
alive O
with O
the O
sounds O
of O
grasshoppers B-ART
, O
crickets O
and O
the O
like O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
atop O
a O
large O
knoll O
which O
apparently O
served O
as O
a O
cemetery O
at O
some O
point O
in O
time O
. O
Remains O
of O
a O
picket B-ART
fence I-ART
lie O
strewn O
about O
the O
hillside O
and O
most O
of O
the O
gravestones B-ART
have O
disintegrated O
beyond O
recognition O
. O
One O
granite O
marker B-ART
at O
the O
head O
of O
a O
grassless O
plot B-ART
, O
however O
, O
remains O
intact O
. O


A O
rather O
tall O
hill O
sprouts O
out O
of O
the O
landscape O
here O
, O
casting O
a O
deep O
shadow O
to O
the O
east O
. O
A O
well O
traveled O
path O
leads O
up O

I'm O
too O
old O
for O
this O
nonsense O
is O
your O
first O
thought O
after O
a O
brief O
journey O
over O
the O
crest O
of O
the O
hill O
to O
this O
dirt O
outcropping O
on O
the O
north O
side O

Momentarily O
ignoring O
your O
aching O
joints O
and O
brief O
memory O
lapses O
, O
you O
spot O
a O
trail O
heading O
south O
up O
the O
hill O
. O
Oddly O
, O
the O
trail O
shows O
signs O
of O
fresh O
footprints B-ART
. O


Wisps O
of O
steam O
rise O
off O
of O
the O
charred B-ART
timbers O
of O
what O
was O
once O
a O
fair O
sized O
building O

Small O
flames O
flare O
up O
occasionally O
producing O
a O
deep O
crackling O
sound O
. O
Paper O
thin O
pieces O
of O
ash B-ART
float O
hither O
and O
yon O

An O
odd B-ART
shaped I-ART

lies O
on O
the O

Above O
all O
the O

out O
the O
tinny O
ragtime O

The O
barkeep B-ART

shoveling O
out O

A O
small O
stream O
flowing O
from O
the O
west O
is O
only O
slightly O
hampered O
here O
by O
a O
deteriorating O
beaver O
dam O
which O
has O
formed O
a O
large O
deep O
pool O
of O
crystal O
clear O

Chokecherry B-ART

is O
thick O
with O

The O
main O
trail O
surrenders O
here O
to O
thick O
brush O
and O
thicket O
making O
further O
progress O
impossible O
. O
A O
faded O
sign B-ART
is O
nailed O
to O
a O
huge O
willow B-ART
tree I-ART
whose O
long O
narrow O
branches B-ART
just O
touch O
the O
ground O

You O
can O
pick O
up O
the O
main O

to O
the O
northwest O

The O
north O
south O
path O
widens O
at O
the O
base O
of O
a O
steep O
rocky O
hill O
where O
an O
apparently O
large O
mining O
operation O
once O
stood O
. O
Another O
trail O
heads O
off O

. O
Narrow O
gauge O
tracks O
come O
down O
a O
small O
knoll O
to O
the O
wide O
entrance O
carved B-ART
into O
the O
hill O
. O
The O
entrance O
has O
been O
boarded O
over O
with O
thick O
timber B-ART
and O
bears O
the O
notice O
KEEP O

in O
crudely O

. O
There O
is O
sign B-ART
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
entrance O
. O


The O
path O
winds O
through O
thick O
bramble O
to O
a O
secluded O
clearing O
. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
clearing O
is O
a O
tall O
wooden B-ART
derrick I-ART

Various O

including O
a O

Narrow O
gauge O
tracks O
come O
down O
a O
small B-ART
knoll O
down O
to O
the O
wide O
entrance O
carved O
into O
the O
hill O
. O
A O
mass O
of O
broken O
timbers B-ART
surround O
the O
base O
of O
the O
foreboding O
entrance O
to O
the O
west O
. O
There O
is O
a O
sign B-ART
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
entrance O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
dark O
mine O
shaft O
. O
The O
tracks O
coming O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
east O
end O
here O
. O
On O
the O
tracks O
, O
you O
see O
an O
ore B-ART
car I-ART
. O
Up O
high O
in O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
shaft O
, O
there O
is O
a O
narrow O
dark O
opening O
. O
You O
can O
proceed O
west O
to O
go O
deeper O
into O
the O
mine O
or O
exit O
the O
mine O
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
shaft O
narrows O
here O
to O
a O
mere O
crawlway O
. O
There O
is O
a O
small B-ART
crack I-ART
in O
one O
of O
the O
walls O
. O


The O
mine O
shaft O
opens O
here O
into O
a O
large O
chamber O
. O
Light O
streams O
in O
from O
a O
three O
foot O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
. O
Presumably O
, O
the O
hole B-ART
was O
chiseled O
in O
the O
rock O
as O
a O
vent B-ART
for O
the O
mine O
system O
. O
You O
can O
see O
the O
mine O
shaft O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
on O
a O
narrow O
platform O
at O
the O
very O
top O
of O
the O
oil B-ART
derrick I-ART
. O
The O
platform O
is O
spotted O
with O
a O
number O
of O
bird O
droppings B-ART
. O
The O
view O
from O
here O
is O
mostly O
obstructed O
by O
trees O
, O
but O
you O
can O
make O
out O
the O
hill O
with O
the O
mine O
to O
the O
west O
. O


This O
small B-ART
jail I-ART
was O
not O
designed O
for O
the O
comfort O
of O
its O
occupants O
. O
It O
is O
impossible O
to O
stand O
without O
hunching O
over O
and O
you O
can O
touch O
any O
two O
walls O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
The O
only O
relief O
from O
the O
crumbling O
stucco O
walls O
is O
the O
iron B-ART
barred I-ART
door B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


The O
heat O
is O
stifling O
at O
this O
barren B-ART
strip O
of O
track O
seemingly O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nowhere O
. O
Even O
the O
ever O
present O
weeds O
have O
given O
up O
this O
area O
as O
hopeless O
and O
only O
a O
few O
cacti O
have O
managed O
to O
gain O
a O
foothold O
in O
the O
constantly O
shifting O
sand O
. O
One O
of O
the O
rails B-ART
has O
become O
dislodged O
, O
forming O
a O
six O
inch O
gap B-ART
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
tracks B-ART
. O


Your O
makeshift O
railroad O
comes O
to O
an O
end O
here O
as O
several O
feet O
of O
sand O
cover O
the O
tracks O
. O
Right O
next O
to O
the O
tracks O
to O
the O
south O
is O
a O
small B-ART
sod I-ART
structure I-ART
with O
a O
faded B-ART
sign I-ART
on O
top O
. O


The O
far O
end O
of O
the O
canyon O
ends O
abruptly O
at O
this O
solid O
wall O
of O
sandstone O
which O
ascends O
over O
fifty O
feet O
from O
where O
you O
are O
standing O
. O
The O
trail O
winds O
around O
some O
scrub O
brush O
to O
a O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
rocks I-ART
which O
rests O
against O
the O
face O
of O
the O
wall O
. O


Water O
hasn't O
found O
its O
way O
down O
this O
rocky O
streambed O
for O
years O
by O
the O
looks O
of O
all O
the O
weeds O
and O
wildflowers O
growing O
between O
the O
rocks O
. O
A O
grove B-ART
of I-ART
gatewood I-ART
trees I-ART
with O
thick O
underbrush O
prevents O
any O
further O
progress O
west O
. O
There O
is O
a O
tunnel O
to O
the O
east O
with O
thick O
bramble O
at O
the O
entrance O
, O
and O
the O
path O
heading O
north O
along O
the O
streambed O
. O


Progress O
up O
the O
stream O
bed O
is O
slow O
due O
to O
the O
large O
rocks O
and O
tall O
weeds O
. O
A O
large O
gatewood B-ART
tree I-ART
has O
fallen O
here O
and O
is O
well O
along O
its O
return O
to O
the O
elements O
. O
The O
path O
follows O
the O
streambed O
to O
the O
south O
and O
continues O
north O
to O
a O
small O
structure O
. O


The O
streambed O
turn O
east O
here O
and O
vanishes O
into O
the O
thick O
bushes O
and O
weeds O
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
an O
old O
run O
down O
shack O
which O
looks O
several O
years O
past O
its O
prime O
. O
There O
is O
a O
hitching B-ART
post I-ART
just O
outside O
the O
door B-ART
. O


The O
Biscuit B-ART
Residence O
would O
hardly O
constitute O
a O
walk O
in O
closet O
by O
your O
standards O
, O
but O
what O
it O
lacks O
in O
size O
is O
more O
than O
made O
up O
for O
by O
the O
charming O
decor O
of O
splintered O
wood B-ART
, O
dense O
cobwebs O
, O
and O
the O
occasional O
trail O
of O
mouse O

. O
There O
is O
a O
small O
wood B-ART
stove I-ART
nestled O
in O
one O
of O
the O
corners O
, O
whereas O
in O
the O

corner O

a O

There O
are O
a O

In O
front O
of O
the O
stove B-ART

you O
can O
just O
make O
out O
a O
good O
sized O
rectangular O
cutout B-ART
in O
the O
wood B-ART
floor O
. O


This O
low O
ellipsoidal O
room B-ART
makes O
you O
uncomfortable O
with O
its O
perfect O
symmetry O
and O
sterility O
. O
The O
featureless O
white O
wall B-ART
is O
broken O
up O
only O
by O
the O
large O
elliptical B-ART
window B-ART
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
and O
the O
circular B-ART
doorway I-ART
through O
which O
you O
entered O

A O
cluster B-ART

sits O
in O
the O

among O
the O
trees O

A O
narrow O
trail B-ART
winds O
down O
the O
north O
side O
of O
the O
hill B-ART

towards O
the O

You're O
on O
a O
rocky B-ART
path B-ART
that O
runs O
east O
and O
west O
along O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
Witchville O
River B-ART
. O
A O
shimmering O
trail B-ART
leads O
south O
into O
a O
dense O

You O

standing O
in O
an O
open O
field O
west O
of O
a O
white O
house B-ART
, O
with O
a O

A O

You're O
standing O
in O
the O
lobby B-ART
of O
the O
movie B-ART

A O
short O
corridor B-ART
leads O
north O
into O
darkness B-ART
. O
Sound O
effects O
and O
music O
can O
be O
heard O
drifting O
down O
the O
corridor B-ART

This O
is O
a O
movie B-ART
theater I-ART
unlike O
any O
you've O
ever O
seen O
! O
The O
seats B-ART
are O
wide O
, O
deep O
and O
comfortable O
. O
The O
aisles B-ART
are O
spotless O
. O
The O
air O
is O
clear O
of O
smoke O
, O
and O
the O
screen B-ART
is O
dramatically O
large O
. O
A O
chill O
goes O
up O
your O
spine O
as O
you O
realize O
how O
alien O
your O
universe O
has O
become O
. O


You're O
standing O
near O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
Pleasure O
Wharf B-ART

The O
Wharf B-ART
extends O
eastward O
into O
Witchville O
Bay B-ART

This O
old O
building B-ART
is O
the O
home O
of O
a O
sleazy O
arcade B-ART
, O
lined O
with O
coin O
op O
video O
games B-ART
. O
The O
machines B-ART
are O
crowded O
with O
half O
crazed O
, O
stunted O
humanoids B-ART
, O
who O
pay O
no O
attention O
to O
you O
as O
they B-ART
satisfy O
their O
thirst O
for O
electric O
violence O
. O


You're O
standing O
in O
a O
dimly O
lit O
vestibule B-ART
just O
inside O
the O
tower's B-ART
entrance B-ART
. O
The O
drawbridge B-ART
is O
opened O
across O
the O
moat O
to O
the O
north O
. O
A O
short O
corridor B-ART
leads O
south O
, O
into O
the O
tower B-ART
. O


You're O
chained B-ART
up O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
a O
dim O
, O
stuffy O
chamber B-ART
, O
deep O
within O
the O
bowels O
of O
the O
tower B-ART
. O
The O
walls B-ART
gleam O
with O
obscure O
medical O
instruments B-ART
, O
and O
a O
diabolical O
torture O
machine B-ART
occupies O
most O
of O
the O
opposite O
corner O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
round O
chamber B-ART
at O
the O
very O
heart O
of O
the O
tower B-ART
. O
The O
clammy O
stone B-ART
walls I-ART
are O
hung O
with O
a O
series B-ART
of I-ART
paintings I-ART
, O
all O
the O
same O
size O
and O
identically O
framed O
. O
Years O
of O
neglect O
have O
blackened O
the O
art O
almost O
beyond O
recognition O
. O


The O
highest O
room B-ART
in O
the O
tower B-ART
is O
a O
laboratory B-ART
, O
complete O
with O
bubbling O
chemicals B-ART
and O
foul O
odors O
. O
An O
antique O
telescope B-ART
is O
mounted O
near O
an O
open O
window B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
a O
control O
panel B-ART
occupies O
most O
of O
the O
south O
wall B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
cottage B-ART
of O
Miss O
Voss B-ART
, O
the O
former O
town B-ART
librarian O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
lined O
with O
timeworn O
books B-ART
and I-ART
dusty I-ART
, O
faded O
photographs B-ART
. O
Looks O
like O
nobody's O
lived O
here O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O


You're O
standing O
before O
a O
large O
desk B-ART
at O
the O
library B-ART
entrance B-ART
. O
The O
top O
of O
the O
desk B-ART
is O
almost O
hidden O
under O
a O
clutter O
of O
books B-ART
, O
all O
grey O
with O
dust B-ART
. O


Formerly O
a O
popular O
tourist O
attraction O
, O
the O
old O
Festeron O
Museum B-ART
is O
in O
a O
sorry O
state O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
best O
exhibits B-ART
have O
been O
carted O
away O
; O
the O
few O
remaining O
are O
sorely O
in O
need O
of O
renovation O
. O


You're O
standing O
dumbfounded O
and O
humiliated O
on O
the O
stage B-ART
of O
the O
Compass B-ART
Club O
. O
There's O
nothing O
left O
to O
do O
than O
to O
swallow O
your O
defeat O
and O
climb O
down O
the O
stage B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
center O
of O
the O
Compass B-ART
Club O
. O
Most O
people B-ART
don't O
orient O
themselves O
in O
relation O
to O
compass B-ART
directions O
, O
but O
here O
it's O
more O
than O
natural O
. O
A O
huge O
compass B-ART
rose I-ART
is O
painted O
to O
the O
ceiling B-ART
and O
the O
abbreviations O
of O
cardinal O
directions O
are O
painted O
on O
the O
walls O
. O


The O
sharp O
spotlights B-ART
in O
this O
southeastern O
corner B-ART
of O
the O
club O
create O
dark B-ART
and O
gloomy O
shadows B-ART
around O
the O
tables B-ART
. O


In O
this O
corner O
of O
the O
club O
there's O
a O
collection O
of O
arcade B-ART
machines I-ART
. O
This O
is O
where O
all O
the O
tough O
kids O
like O
to O
hang O
out O
. O


The O
people B-ART
who O
are O
performing O
in O
the O
club O
usually O
hang O
around O
here O
by O
the O
stage B-ART
. O


A O
club O
wouldn't O
be O
a O
club O
if O
it O
didn't O
have O
a O
bar B-ART
. O
The O
selection B-ART
of I-ART
drinks I-ART
is O
written O
on O
a O
chalkboard B-ART
behind O
the O
counter B-ART
next O
to O
an O
educational B-ART
poster B-ART
. O


This O
area O
is O
reserved O
to O
those O
with O
VIP O
passes O
. O
There O
are O
cushy B-ART
red I-ART
sofas I-ART
to O
sit O
on O
and O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
drunken O
idiots O
crashing O
your O
table B-ART
. O


Just O
being O
here O
makes O
your O
heart O
beat O
faster O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
adorned O
by O
portraits B-ART
of O
past O
champions O
, O
each O
a O
part O
of O
great O
history O
. O


If O
you O
ever O
get O
out O
of O
here O
, O
you O
really O
must O
complain O
to O
the O
prison's O
standards O
officers O
. O
This O
place O
is O
dirtier O
and O
dustier O
than O
a O
dirt O
factory O
. O
If O
you O
didn't O
have O
better O
things O
to O
do O
, O
you'd O
be O
in O
the O
right O
mind O
too O
give O
the O
place O
a O
jolly O
good O
clean O
just O
too O
spite O
it O
. O
There's O
a O
heavily O
built O
door B-ART
to O
the O
south O
. O


Another O
section O
of O
corridor O
that O
leads O
south O
into O
a O
room O
of O
some O
sort O
and O
west O
back O
towards O
your O
old B-ART
cell O
. O


The O
armoury O
is O
very O
sparsely O
stocked O
. O
If O
it O
where O
not O
for O
the O
bid O
red O
sign B-ART
that O
proclaims O
ARMOURY O
! O
you'd O
probably O
guess O
it O
was O
just O
another O
cell O
. O
. O
. O


Some O
kind O
of O
control B-ART
room O
. O
Unfortunatly O
you O
fail O
to O
see O
a O
big O
button B-ART
marked O
Disable O
security O
devices O
. O
. O
. O
Might O
have O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
subtle O
. O


A O
reasonably O
large O
hall O
with O
a O
security B-ART
camera I-ART
positioned O
to O
the O
far O
north O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
that O
inhumane O
stainless O
steel B-ART
white O
that O
turns O
your O
brain O
to O
mush O
after O
looking O
at O
it O
for O
a O
while O
. O


A O
lift O
. O
There's O
a O
button B-ART
that O
says O
Down O
on O
it O
and O
also O
a O
door O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
room O
is O
large O
administration O
office O
with O
two O
desks O
stacked O
with O
papers O
, O
which O
behind O
sit O
two O
office O
workers B-ART
, O
one O
male B-ART
and O
one O
female B-ART
. O
There O
are O
corridors O
emitting O
from O
this O
room O
in O
every O
direction B-ART
and O
a O
sign B-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART
that O
seems O
to O
explain O
where O
each O
of O
these O
corridors O
goes O
. O


Finally O
, O
a O
bar O
! O
Somewhere O
to O
quench O
your O
thirst O
for O
a O
pint O
of O
smooth O
, O
creamy O
ale O
. O
. O
. O
Your O
mouth O
begins O
to O
dribble O
, O
until O
you O
realise O
you O
have O
no O
money O
to O
speak O
of O
. O
. O
. O
. O
Your O
heart O
sinks O
, O
and O
you O
pause O
to O
take O
in O
the O
surroundings O
. O
It O
looks O
rather O
like O
a O
20th O
century O
wine O
bar O
, O
with O
classy B-ART
furnishings I-ART
well O
placed O
around O
the O
room O
. O
There O
is O
a O
large O
sign B-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART
. O


Rather O
than O
an O
officers B-ART
social O
hall O
, O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
place O
of O
work O
. O
There O
is O
a O
photocopier B-ART
stood O
on O
a O
table B-ART
and O
a O
smart B-ART
looking I-ART
officer I-ART
type O
sat O
behind O
the O
desk B-ART
. O


Before O
you O
stands O
a O
bulkhead B-ART
door I-ART
, O
looking O
every O
inch O
your O
ticket O
to O
freedom O
. O
Unfortunatly O
, O
it O
doesn't O
appear O
to O
have O
any O
method O
of O
opening O
. O
Back O
to O
the O
south O
you O
can O
see O
a O
large O
room O
, O
while O
to O
your O
east O
lies O
a O
small O
control O
room O
. O


A O
small O
, O
dank O
control O
room O
, O
which O
only O
has O
the O
one O
button B-ART
. O
An O
incredibly O
strange O
state O
of O
affairs O
for O
a O
control O
room O
, O
really O
. O
It's O
a O
big O
button B-ART
, O
if O
it O
helps O
. O


There O
is O
a O
small O
mailbox B-ART
here O
. O


You O
are O
facing O
the O
north O
side O
of O
a O
white O
house B-ART
. O
There O
is O
no O
door O
here O
, O
and O
all O
the O
windows B-ART
are O
boarded B-ART
up O
. O
To O
the O
north O
a O
narrow O
path O
winds O
through O
the O
trees O
. O


This O
is O
a O
path O
winding O
through O
a O
dimly O
lit O
forest O
. O
The O
path O
heads O
north O
south O
here O
. O
One O
particularly O
large O
tree O
with O
some O
low O
branches B-ART
stands O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
path O
. O


Beside O
you O
on O
the O
branch B-ART
is O
a O
small O
bird's B-ART
nest B-ART
. O
In O
the O
bird's B-ART
nest B-ART
is O
a O
large O
egg B-ART
encrusted O
with O
precious O
jewels O
, O
apparently O
scavenged O
by O
a O
childless O
songbird B-ART
. O
The O
egg B-ART
is O
covered O
with O
fine O
gold O
inlay O
, O
and O
ornamented O
in O
lapis O
lazuli O
and O
mother O
of O
pearl O
. O
Unlike O
most O
eggs B-ART
, O
this O
one O
is O
hinged O
and O
closed O
with O
a O
delicate O
looking O
clasp O
. O
The O
egg B-ART
appears O
extremely O
fragile O
. O


You O
are O
behind O
the O
white O
house B-ART
. O
A O
path O
leads O
into O
the O
forest O
to O
the O
east O

In O
one O
corner O
of O
the O
house B-ART
there O
is O
a O
small O

which O
is O
slightly O
ajar O

On O
the O

an O
elongated O
brown O
sack B-ART

the O
east O
, O
a O
wooden O
door B-ART
with O
strange O
gothic O
lettering B-ART

to O
be O
nailed O
shut O
, O
a O
trophy O

a O
large O
oriental O
rug B-ART
in O

a O
small O
room O
with O
passages B-ART
to O
the O
east O

a O
forbidding O

Bloodstains O
and O
deep O
scratches O
perhaps O
made O
by O
an O
axe B-ART
mar O
the O
walls B-ART

A O
nasty O
looking O
troll B-ART
, O
brandishing O
a O
bloody O
axe B-ART
, O
blocks O
all O
passages B-ART
out O
of O
the O
room O

The O
axe B-ART
gets O
you O
right O
in O
the O
side O

Ouch O
! O


There O
are O
old O
engravings B-ART
on O
the O
walls B-ART
here O

of O
a O
large O

which O
forms O
the O
ceiling O
of O
another O

Protecting O
you O

drop O
is O
a O
wooden O

twelve O
somewhat O
flat O
heads B-ART
mounted O
securely O

While O
the O

funerary O
urns O

other O
evidence O
of O
the O
ritual O

of O
the O
ancient O
Zorkers O
, O
it O

is O
a O
roughly O
hewn O
staircase O
leading O
down O
into O
darkness O
. O
The O
landing O
on O
which O
you O
stand O
is O
covered O
with O
carefully O
drawn O
magical O
runes O
like O
those O
sketched O
upon O
the O
workbench O
of O
the O
Wizard O
of O
Frobozz O
. O
These O
have O
been O
overlaid O
with O
sweeping O
green O
lines O
of O
enormous O
power O
, O
which O
undulate O
back O
and O
forth O
across O
the O
landing O
. O
The O
wand B-ART
begins O
to O
vibrate O
in O
harmony O
with O
the O
motion O
of O
the O
lines O
. O
You O
feel O
yourself O
compelled O
downward O
, O
and O
you O
yield O
, O
stepping O
onto O
the O
staircase O
. O
As O
you O
pass O
the O
green O
lines O
, O
they O
flare O
and O
disappear O
with O
a O
burst O
of O
light B-ART
, O
and O
you O
tumble O
down O
the O
staircase O
! O


Your O
old O
friend O
, O
the O
brass O
lantern B-ART
, O
is O
at O
your O
feet O
. O


You O
are O
west O
of O
the O
junction O
, O
where O
the O
rock B-ART
bound O
passage O
widens O
out O
into O
a O
large O
, O
flat O
area O
. O
Although O
the O
land O
here O
is O
barren O
, O
you O
can O
see O
vegetation O
to O
the O
west O
. O
South O
of O
here O
is O
a O
mighty O
wall B-ART
of O
stone O
, O
ancient O
and O
crumbling O
. O
To O
the O
southwest O
the O
wall B-ART
has O
decayed O
enough O
to O
form O
an O
opening O
, O
through O
which O
seeps O
a O
thin O
mist O
. O
A O
trail O
dips O
sharply O
into O
rocky B-ART
terrain O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O


A O
rope O
is O
tied O
to O
one O
of O
the O
large O
trees B-ART
here O
and O
is O
dangling O
over O
the O
side O
of O
the O
cliff O
, O
reaching O
down O
to O
the O
shelf O
below O
. O
It O
seems O
as O
if O
somebody O
has O
been O
here O
recently O
, O
as O
there O
is O
some O
fresh O
bread B-ART
lying O
beneath O
one O
of O
the O
other O
trees B-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
particularly O
damp O
spot O
even O
by O
dungeon O
standards O
. O
You O
can O
see O
a O
crossroads O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
two O
nearly O
identical O
passages O
lead O
east O
and O
northeast O
. O
A O
stone O
channel B-ART
, O
wide O
and O
deep O
, O
steeply O
descends O
into O
the O
room O
from O
the O
south O
. O
It O
is O
covered O
with O
moss B-ART
and I-ART
lichen I-ART
, O
and O
is O
far O
too O
slippery O
to O
climb O
. O
The O
channel B-ART
crosses O
the O
room O
, O
but O
the O
opening O
where O
it O
once O
continued O
north O
is O
now O
blocked O
by O
rubble O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O

heading O
southwest O
and O
southeast O
. O
The O
north O
wall B-ART
is O
ornately O
carved O
, O
filled O
with O
strange O
runes B-ART
and O
writing O
in O
an O
unfamiliar O
language O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
wide O
cavern O
on O
the O
north O
shore O
of O
a O
small O
lake O
. O
Some O
polished O
stone O
steps B-ART
lead O
to O
the O
southeast O
and O
a O
sheer O
rock O
face O
prevents O
any O
movement O
around O
the O
lake O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
The O
cavern O
is O
dimly O
lit O
from O
above O
. O


You O
are O
floating O
on O
the O
surface B-ART
of O
the O
lake O
. O
The O
water B-ART
is O
ice O
cold O
and O
your O
ability O
to O
survive O
here O
for O
long O
is O
very O
questionable O
. O
A O
swim O
north O
puts O
you O
at O
your O
starting O
point O
. O
Conditions O
to O
the O
east O
are O
poor O
where O
the O
lake O
turns O
into O
swamp O
. O
The O
west O
and O
south O
shores O
are O
suitable O
for O
walking O
, O
however O
. O


Something O
sparkling O
in O
the O
sand B-ART
catches O
your O
eye O
for O
a O
moment O
. O


You O
are O
on O
the O
western O
shore O
of O
the O
lake O
. O
The O
ground O
here O
is O
quite O
hard O
, O
but O
a O
few O
sickly O
reeds O
manage O
to O
grow O
near O
the O
water's B-ART
edge O
. O
The O
only O
path O
leads O
into O
the O
rock O
to O
the O
south O
. O


You O
are O
between O
some O
rock O
and O
a O
dark O
place O
, O
The O
room O
is O
lit O
dimly O
from O
above O
, O
revealing O
a O
lone O
, O
dark O
path O
sloping O
down O
to O
the O
west O
. O
To O
one O
side O
of O
the O
room O
is O
a O
large O
manhole O
cover B-ART
. O
The O
light O
from O
above O
seems O
to O
be O
focused O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
, O
where O
a O
single O
key B-ART
is O
lying O
in O
the O
dust O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
wide O
stone O
channel B-ART
, O
part O
of O
the O
water O
supply O
system O
for O
the O
Great O
Underground O
Empire O
. O
The O
source O
of O
water O
was O
a O
waterfall O
to O
the O
south O
, O
which O
has O
long O
since O
dried O
up O
. O
Water O
flowed O
along O
the O
aqueduct B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O
This O
region O
is O
lit O
from O
above O
, O
although O
the O
source O
of O
light O
is O
not O
apparent O
. O


You O
are O
now O
on O
one O
of O
the O
tallest O
arches B-ART
of O
the O
aqueduct B-ART
, O
hundreds O
of O
feet O
above O
a O
rocky O
chasm B-ART
. O
The O
immensity O
of O
the O
aqueduct B-ART
project O
is O
apparent O
from O
here O
. O
Stone O
supports O
rise O
from O
the O
rock O
floor O
to O
form O
massive O
arches B-ART
, O
which O
traverse O
the O
region O
from O
north O
to O
south O
. O
The O
water O
carrying O
channel B-ART
here O
is O
wide O
and O
deep O
. O
To O
the O
west O
and O
far O
below O
, O
you O
can O
make O
out O
a O
balcony O
which O
must O
command O
a O
wide O
view O
of O
the O
aqueduct B-ART
. O


You O
are O
near O
the O
northern O
end O
of O
this O
segment O
of O
the O
aqueduct B-ART
system O
. O
To O
the O
south O
and O
slightly O
uphill O
, O
the O
bulk O
of O
the O
aqueduct B-ART
looms O
ominously O
, O
towering O
above O
a O
gorge O
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
the O
water O
channel B-ART
drops O
precipitously O
and O
enters O
a O
rocky O
hole O
. O
The O
damp O
moss B-ART
and I-ART
lichen I-ART
would O
certainly O
make O
that O
a O
one O

. O


A O
long O
piece O
of O
rope O
is O
dangling O
down O
from O
the O

A O

You O
are O
standing O
at O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
GUE O
Convention O
Center O
. O
On O
the O
floor O
, O
you O
can O
see O
occasional O
splotches O
of O
paint B-ART
through O
the O
grime O
and O
dust O
. O
Although O
the O
whole O

appears O
to O
have O
been O
long O
abandoned O
, O
loud O
, O
low O
pitched O
sounds O
emanate O
from O
the O

standing O
open O
to O
the O

Next O
to O

is O
a O

to O
the O

You O
find O
yourself O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
a O
souvenir O
stand O
that O
is O
clearly O
affiliated O
with O
the O
Convention O

An O
odd O
looking O
salesman B-ART
sits O
behind O
the O
counter B-ART
, O
his O
head O
resting O
on O
his O
hand O
and O
his O

glued O

somewhere O

behind O
you O

A O
notice B-ART
on O
the O
counter B-ART
points O
toward O
a O
small O
, O
curtained O
room O
to O
the O
north O
. O


It O
is O
obvious O
from O
the O
array O
of O
body B-ART
suits I-ART
, I-ART
masks I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
gloves I-ART
heaped O
on O

that O
this O

No O

just O
the O

A O

You O
are O
in O
attendance O
at O
the O
annual O
Grue O
Convention O
, O
this O
year O
a O
rather O
somber O
affair O
due O
to O
the O
adventurer O
famine O
that O
has O
gripped O
gruedom O
in O
this O
isolated O
corner O
of O
the O
empire O
. O
Standing O
at O
a O
lectern O
on O
stage O
, O
a O
prominent O
grue O
is O
presenting O
a O
paper O
entitled O
, O
Surviving O
the O
Lean O
Years O

Lurking O
Enough O
? O
All O
around O
you O
, O
grues B-ART
are O
standing O
; O
some O
in O
conversation O
, O
some O
drinking O
, O
some O
even O
paying O
attention O
to O
the O
speaker O
. O


This O
cavernous O
auditorium O
is O
reputed O
to O
be O
the O
most O
elaborate O
in O
the O
GUE O
. O
Built O
to O
the O
precise O
specifications O
of O
Lord O
Dimwit O
Flathead O
, O
its O
excessive O
structure O
holds O
69 O
, O
105 O
seats B-ART
, O
not O
including O
the O
royal O
box O
seats B-ART
that O
are O
centrally O
situated O
on O
the O
37th O
mezzanine O
. O
The O
seats B-ART
themselves O
are O
built O
like O
thrones B-ART
, O
with O
high O
, O
wooden O
backs O
that O
obscure O
visibility O
and O
make O
the O
seating O
area O
seem O
rather O
like O
a O
forest O
of O
stunted O
trees O
. O
A O
long O
aisle O
runs O
the O
entire O
length O
of O
the O
auditorium O
from O
the O
Cultural O
Center O
to O
the O
west O
to O
the O
oversized O
stage O
to O
the O
east O
. O
In O
all O
other O
directions O
, O
narrow O
aisles O
have O
been O
arranged O
in O
the O
maze O
of O
twisty O
passages O
style O
that O
was O
so O
popular O
in O
Dimwit's O
day O
; O
I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
avoiding O
them O
. O


The O
rather O
large O
proscenium O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
designed O
mainly O
with O
live O
performances O
in O
mind O
the O
dead O
were O
thought O
, O
not O
unreasonably O
, O
to O
be O
dreadfully O
dull O

As O
such O
, O
it O
sports O
a O
large O

A O
thick O
, O
maroon O
curtain B-ART
separates O
the O
backstage O
area O
from O
the O

This O

obviously O
the O

the O
grandeur O
of O
the O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
Cultural O

the O
Hall O

rather O

enough O

there O
is O
no O

it O

a O

Legend O
has O
it O
that O
so O
lifelike O
were O
these O

that O
they O
would O

themselves O

This O
museum O
is O
a O
sick O
, O
twisted O
, O
and O
pitiful O
homage O
to O
that O
special O
creature O
as O
near O
and O
dear O
to O
my O
heart O
as O
a O
parser O
, O
the O

There O
, O
in O
the O

a O

shiver O
up O
your O
spine B-ART
A O
skeleton B-ART

On O
the O
small O
pedestal B-ART
beside O
it O
sits O
a O
plaque B-ART

The O
walls B-ART
have O
been O
clawed O
, O
the O
wallpaper B-ART
and O
exhibit O
signs B-ART
shredded O
by O
what O
was O
probably O
an O
over O
excited O
tourist O
group O
of O
grues O

In O
what O
looks O
like O
the O
remnants O
of O
their O
enthusiastic O
visit O
, O
piles B-ART

bones I-ART
lie O
on O
the O

One O
sign B-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART
by O
a O
door B-ART
to O
the O

remains O
, O
though O
. O


As O
you O
step O
through O
the O
doorway O
, O
you O
realize O
you've O
entered O
a O
room O
so O
vast O
, O
you O
can O
see O
the O
distant O
curvature O
of O
the O
Earth O
. O
On O
the O
distant O
, O
foggy O
horizon O
, O
the O
ceiling B-ART
appears O
to O
meet O
the O
floor O
, O
blending O
in O
the O
mist O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
in O
this O
enormous O
, O
cavernous O
area O
are O
shelves B-ART
, I-ART
shelves I-ART
and O
more O
shelves B-ART
, O
all O
of O
them O
empty O
, O
dwindling O
into O
nothingness O
. O
This O
of O
course O
disproves O
the O
ancient O
belief O
that O
there's O
never O
enough O
closet O
space O
. O


This O
area O
was O
designed O
for O
some O
otherworldly O
visitors O
, O
and O
judging O
by O
the O
sounds O
emanating O
from O
the O
many O
passages O
heading O
off O
to O
the O
east O
, O
they're O
still O
around O
. O
Dangling O
on O
the O
bars B-ART
is O
a O
small O
sign B-ART

reads O

Sheez O
, O
it's O
slippery O
up O
here O
. O
The O
woven O
black O
iron O
grille O
of O
the O
catwalk B-ART
isn't O
providing O
much O
traction O
, O
now O
that O
it's O
spattered O
with O
rainwater B-ART
, O
which O
is O
coming O
down O
in O
goblike O
droplets O
and O
streams O
, O
seemingly O
from O
everywhere O
, O
spattering O
off O
the O
rigging B-ART
and O
the O
lamps B-ART
, O
and O
running O
in O
curvy O
trickles O
down O
the O
insulated O
wiring O
. O


You're O
of O
two B-ART
minds O
about O
this O
. O
One O
is O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
crazy O
to O
be O
crouching O
here O
on O
top O
of O
the O
burning O
lamps B-ART
themselves O
, O
the O
other O
is O
that O
it's O
really O
exciting O
and O
interesting O
, O
something O
you O
never O
get O
to O
see O
. O
Particularly O
thick O
rivulets O
of O
water B-ART
cascading O
over O
the O
backs O
and O
faces O
of O
burning O
hot O
lamps B-ART
, O
breaking O
into O
sparks O
of O
color O
and O
light B-ART
. O


The O
Treehouse O
is O
about O
six O
feet O
long O
and O
two O
foot O
wide O
, O
plenty O
of O
space O
to O
walk O
or O
sit O
, O
but O
the O
rain O
is O
making O
it O
treacherous O
. O
The O
joist O
plank O
is O
normally O
stable O
even O
out O
at O
the O
far O
unspported O
end O
, O
but O
today O
it O
feels O
like O
it O
has O
more O
spring O
to O
it O
. O
Maybe O
the O
humidity O
made O
it O
flexible O
or O
something O
, O
but O
a O
good O
bounce O
on O
it O
and O
it'd O
start O
oscillating O
like O
a O
diving O
board O
right B-ART
now O
. O
It O
also O
feels O
slicker O
under O
your O
boots O
than O
usual O
probably O
all O
the O
oil O
from O
a O
dozen O
years O
of O
mayonnaise O
laden O
sandwich O
drippings O
is O
floating O
to O
the O
surface O
. O
Below B-ART
is O
the O
catwalk O
, O
and O
under O
that O
is O
the O
lighting B-ART
grid I-ART
, O
its O
cables B-ART
snaking O
up O
to O
J B-ART
hooks I-ART
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
and O
down O
the O
back O

, O
just O
within O
reach O
of O
here O
. O


Where O
all O
old O
studio O
junk B-ART
goes O
to O
die O
. O
You've O
looked O
through O
this O
stuff O
before O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
that'd O
even O
clear O
a O
few O
bucks O
at O
a O
yard O
sale O
, O
but O
management O
caught O
you O
at O
it O
and O
declared O
every O
piece O
of O
crap O
here O
to O
be O
off O
limits O
private O
property O
. O
There's O
a O
jug B-ART
of I-ART
fertilizer I-ART
and O
a O
feather B-ART
boa I-ART
here O
. O
Yeah O
, O
whatever O
. O


Nothing O
to O
see O
here O
but O
a O
dank O
corridor O
of O
padded O
gray B-ART
walls O
, O
like O
the O
inside O
of O
an O
asylum O
, O
which O
as O
far O
as O
you're O
concerned O
, O
it O
is O

A O

Only O
that's O
you O
lies O
north O
, O
and O
the O
glare B-ART
of O
the O

is O
back O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


This O
is O
your O
home O
, O
your O
domain O
, O
where O
things O
are O
supposed O
to O
go O
where O
you O
can O
always O
find O
them O
again O

the O

You're O
starting O
to O
feel O
a O
little O
better O
about O

state O

Everything O
is O
sorted O
into O
the O
proper O
plastic B-ART
tub O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
you O
feel O
a O
sense O
of O
peace O
and O
serenity O
flowing O
over O
you O
as O
you O
look O
at O
how O
spiffy O
everything O
is O
again O
. O
Ahh O
. O
That O
was O
well O
worth O
doing O
after O
all O
. O
Maybe O
you O
can O
even O
deal O
with O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
. O


Ah O
, O
your O
home O
, O
your O
domain O
. O
Everything O
in O
order O
, O
unlike O
every O
other O
square O
foot O
of O
this O
place O
. O
Just O
being O
in O
here O
makes O
you O
feel O
a O
little O
better O
about O
everything O

Cleaning O

the O

Through O
the O

you O
can O

some O

The O
scent O

nearly O
obscures O
what O
your O

up O
the O

At O
the O

you O
pause O

A O

at O

perhaps O
it O
will O
give O
you O
just O
enough O

you O
the O

There O
are O
lights O
just O

the O

the O

The O
road O
is O
clotted O
with O
deep O
snow B-ART

and O
a O
fog O
rolls O
in O

you O
progress O

making O
you O
lose O
your O
sense O

You O
halt O
at O
what O
seems O
to O

a O
dead O

as O

The O

completely O
by O
the O

of O
a O
great O
alabaster O
tree O

which O
has O
grown O
not O
just O
upward O

outward O

providing O
a O
leafy O

a O
good O

Blinded O

the O
glare B-ART

the O
studio B-ART

heating O
you O

a O
sweltering O

you O
can O
barely O
make O
out B-ART
the O

studio B-ART

sitting O
in O
bleachers B-ART
up O

down O

you O
over O
the O

his O
round O

The O
great O
tree B-ART
has O
grown O
to O
overtake O
nearly O
the O
entire O
breadth O
of O
the O
plaza B-ART
, O
its O
vast O
maze O
of O
branches B-ART
creaking O
and O
waving O
in O
the O

, O
straining O
at O
greater O
height O

Three O
great O
threads O
of O
stone B-ART
, O
metal O
, O
and O
darker O
wood O
weave O
and O
wind O
up O
the O
bark B-ART
, O
having O
somehow O
grown O
into O
or O
along O
with O
the O
tree B-ART

The O
stalks B-ART
of I-ART
grass I-ART
are O
dried O
golden O
brown O
now O
, O
waving O
in O
the O
hot O

. O


The O
other O
harvesters O
are O
bringing O
the O
reapings O
in O
from O
the O
fields O

emptying O
their O

Two O
women B-ART
sit O
crosslegged O

the O

the O
threshing B-ART
floor O
, O
stacking B-ART
bundles B-ART
of I-ART
wheat I-ART
tips I-ART
that O
they O
have O
neatly O
tied O
. O


The O
pile O
of O
chaff O
is O
not O
endless O
, O
but O
it O
goes O
on O
and O
on O
, O
the O
way O
a O
waste O

does O
. O
Parts O
of O
it O
are O
on O
fire O
, O
not O
in O
flames O

just O
smoldering O
, O
giving O
off O
toxic O
fumes O

At O
the O
far O
end O
to O
the O
north O
, O
a O
great B-ART
oven I-ART
is O
being O
prepared O
and O
stoked O
. O
The O
chaff O
will O
all O
be O
burned O
. O


The O
great B-ART
oven I-ART
is O
the O
size O
of O
seven O
huts O

made O
of O
clay O

At O
the O
edges O
it O
is O
a O
sinister O
cherry O
red B-ART

but O
near O
its O
belching O

windy O
core O
it O
is O
yellow O
and O
fire O
white B-ART

To O
the O
north O
is O
the O
long O
road O
home O
. O


The O
great O
tree B-ART
reaches O
a O
height O
beyond O
mortal O
ken O
, O
higher O
than O
the O
gate B-ART
that O
used O
to O
float O
in O
an O
open O
sky B-ART

now O
looking O
distantly O
like O
the O
tiny O
top O
deck O
of O
a O
treehouse B-ART

The O
trunk O
of O
the O
tree B-ART
appears O
to O
have O
fossilized O
, O
being O
as O
stone B-ART

the O
same O
stone B-ART
that O
formed O
a O
third O
of O
the O
triangular B-ART

now O
carved B-ART

the O

Higher O
up O

the O
tree B-ART
shines O
in O
the O
light O
, O
glinting O
like O
metal O
, O
the O
trunk O
made O
of O
bronze B-ART

its O

made O
of O

Leicester O
Square O
has O
a O
more O
casual O
feel O
than O
Trafalgar O
due O
to O
its O
smaller O
size O
, O
preponderance O
of O
grassy O
space O
, O
and O
lack O
of O
any O
major O
monuments O

A O

more O
than O
a O
nook O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
ticket O

, O
the O
business O
office O
is O
full O
of O

In O
the O

The O
hallway B-ART

hemmed O
in O
by O
the O
plywood B-ART

for O
the O
next O
play O
, O
which O
has O
apparently O
not O
yet O
had O
doorways B-ART
cut O
into O
it O
, O
because O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O

through O
it O
onto O
the O
stage O

No O
one O

working O

toolboxes B-ART

that O
the O

eventually O
return O

The O
hallway B-ART
continues O
east O

During O

, O
this O
would O
be O
the O

the O

for O

the O

You O
can O

nothing O

The O

the O
impression O
of O
a O

The O

Uniformed O
Bobbies B-ART

Little O
more O
than O
a O

the O

is O
dominated O
by O
racks B-ART

as O
well O

You O

The O

against O
the O
north O
wall O
, O
a O
simple O
slab O
of O
grey O

The O
only O
other O
thing O
that O

the O

is O
the O

the O

Around O

piled O
so O
high O
that O
by O
looking O
up O
you O

It O
reminds O
you O
of O
a O

The O
only O

The O

in O
a O
nice O
teak O

the O

Considering O
that O
you O
either O
eat O
out O

in O
most O

you O
rarely O

This O
space B-ART
, O
barely O
wider O
than O

seems O
to O
have O
been O
chopped O
raw O

square O
from O

Only O
the O
floor O
is O
smooth B-ART
a O
fine O
white B-ART
surface I-ART
beneath O
your O
feet O
. O
There O
is O
a O
narrow B-ART
gap I-ART
in O
the O

You O
are O
standing O
in O
a O
short B-ART

To O

out O

To O
the O
west O
, O
the O
hallway B-ART
narrows I-ART
, O
ending O
in O
a O
small B-ART
gap I-ART
of O
a O

You O
stand B-ART
amid O

The O

broad O
, O
centered O
around O
a O
massive B-ART

well I-ART
worn I-ART
wooden B-ART

But O
so O
much O
is O
jammed O
in O
, O
around O
the O
desk B-ART
and O
up O
the O
panelled B-ART
walls B-ART
, O
that O
you O
barely O

This O

flickering I-ART
candles B-ART
above I-ART
; O
intricate B-ART
geometric I-ART
marks I-ART
cover O
the O
floor O
. O
The O
hall O
curves O
gently O
away O
in O
all O
eight O
directions O
. O


Here O
, O
in O
the O
forest B-ART
where O
you O
have O
spent O
your O
entire O
life O
, O
stands O
a O
huge O
Edifice O
, O
reaching O
into O
the O
clouds O
high O
above O
you O
. O


Green O
sunlight O
filters O
in O
from O
the O
west O
through O
the O
open B-ART
recess I-ART
, O
illuminating O
a O
small O
, O
round O
room O
, O
simple B-ART
but O
totally O
foreign O
to O
you O
. O
A O
staircase B-ART
when O
did O
you O
learn O
that O
word O
? O
winds O
up O
along O
the O
curved O
wall B-ART
to O
another O
level B-ART
above O
you O
, O
and O
, O
oddly O
, O
another O
doorway B-ART
leads O
east O
, O
as O
if O
it O
would O
lead O
back O
into O
the O
forest B-ART
. O


Well O
, O
this O
certainly O
isn't O
the O
Forest O
you've O
come O
to O
know O
and O
love O
. O
You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
vast O
grassland B-ART
, O
broken O
only O
by O
the O
incongruous B-ART
stone B-ART
arch I-ART
you O
passed O
through O
on O
your O
way O
here O
. O
Through O
it O
, O
you O
can O
see O
back O
into O
the O
dimly O
lit O
Edifice O
to O
the O
west O
, O
a O
sharp O
contrast O
to O
the O
bright O
sunlight O
all O
around O
you O
. O


The O
land O
here O
is O
divided O
by O
a O
stream O
, O
which O
has O
collected O
to O
form O
a O
wide B-ART
, O
still O
pool O
. O


The O
lush O
grassland O
to O
the O
south O
and O
southwest O
begins O
to O
get O
rocky B-ART
here O
. O
Just O
at O
the O
border O
between O
grassland O
and O
rocks B-ART
, O
a O
mighty O
Tree B-ART
towers O
above O
you O
. O


Climbing O
trees B-ART
is O
a O
lot O
harder O
than O
you O
remember O
. O
You've O
managed O
to O
position O
yourself O
about O
three B-ART
quarters I-ART
of O
the O
way O
up O
the O
tree B-ART
, O
and O
are O
sitting O
in O
a O
fork B-ART
in O
the O
trunk B-ART
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
open B-ART
grassland I-ART
, O
the O
only O
visible O
tree O
far O
to O
the O
north O
. O
Despite O
your O
history O
of O
living O
in O
a O
forest O
, O
the O
wide O
open B-ART
space O
feels O
free O
and O
natural O
, O
as O
if O
you O
had O
spent O
your O
entire O
life O
here O
. O


The O
main O
feature O
of O
this O
area O
of O
the O
grassland O
is O
a O
large B-ART
, I-ART
squat I-ART
, I-ART
blackened I-ART
Stump I-ART
, O
evidently O
a O
victim B-ART
of O
a O
past O
brush O
fire O
. O
The O
grasses B-ART
wave O
around O
Stump B-ART
, O
and O
one O
or O
two O
have O
taken O
root O
in O
the O
Stump B-ART
itself O
. O
Some O
day O
, O
this O
will O
be O
little O
more O
than O
a O
rise O
in O
the O
countryside O
. O


The O
lush O
grassland B-ART
to O
the O
west O
begins O
to O
peter O
out O
here O
, O
becoming O
more O
rocky B-ART
, O
dry B-ART
, O
and O
hilly O
. O


Here O
you O
see O
the O
beginnings O
of O
a O
small O
spring B-ART
. O


This O
room O
is O
akin O
to O
the O
room O
below O
. O
There O
are O
staircases B-ART
going O
up O
and O
down O
, O
and O
another O
door B-ART
going O
east O
. O


This O
is O
a O
small B-ART
, O
cleared O
area O
in O
front O
of O
your O
Hut B-ART
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
forest O
. O
The O
autumn B-ART
leaves I-ART
crunch O
under O
your O
feet O
, O
and O
the O
smell O
of O
winter O
is O
in O
the O
air O
. O
A O
well O
worn O
path B-ART
runs O
to O
the O
south O
towards O
the O
sound O
of O
rushing O
water O
, O
and O
another O
leads O
north O
, O
deeper O
into O
the O
forest O
. O


You O
are O
inside O
the O
hut O
where O
it O
seems O
you O
have O
lived O
all O
your O
life O
. O
You O
live O
here O
with O
Grandmother B-ART
your O
Mother B-ART
, O
Wife B-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
Son I-ART
. O
The O
normally O
homey O
smell O
you O
associate O
with O
this O
place O
is O
currently O
masked O
by O
the O
smell O
of O
sickness B-ART
. O
Stray O
light O
and O
fresh O
air O
come O
in O
around B-ART
a O
hide O
covered O
doorway O
, O
back O
to O
the O
west O
, O
but O
they O
do O
little O
to O
mask O
the O
sense O
of O
dread O
and O
concern O
that O
hangs O
over O
everyone B-ART
in O
this O
room O
. O


This O
is O
the O
forest B-ART
where O
you O
hunt O
for O
food O
and O
skins O
, O
though O
you O
don't O
believe O
you'll O
be O
hunting O
much O
today O
. O
Some O
birds B-ART
still O
chirp O
in O
the O
trees O
, O
though O
many O
have O
flown O
away O
, O
as O
they O
do O
every B-ART
winter O
. O
The O
rustle O
of O
wind B-ART
through O
the O
golden B-ART
leaves I-ART
counterpoints O
your O
own O
footsteps O
, O
as O
you O
wend O
your O
way O
through O
the O
forest B-ART
. O
The O
path B-ART
you O
used O
to O
get O
here O
goes O
back O
south O
, O
and O
another O
path B-ART
leads O
northeast O
, O
which O
you've O
never O
used O
before O
today O
. O


You've O
emerged O
from O
the O
northeast O
path O
to O
another O
Hut B-ART
, O
rather O
like O
your O
own O
. O
This O
one O
is O
larger O
, O
though O
, O
and O
has O
woven B-ART
leaves I-ART
as O
a O
doorway B-ART
instead O
of O
a O
hide O
. O
This O
Hut B-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
, O
or O
you O
can O
go O
back O
down O
the O
path O
you O
came O
from O
the O
southwest O
. O


Here O
, O
a O
river B-ART
wider I-ART
across O
than O
you O
can O
throw O
a O
stone O
flows B-ART
past O
. O
You O
sometimes O
catch O
fish O
here O
, O
and O
your O
son O
loves O
to O
come O
here O
and O
skip O
rocks O
across O
the O
river's B-ART
surface O
. O
Many O
white B-ART
barked I-ART
trees B-ART
grow O
close O
to O
the O
river's B-ART
edge O
here O
, O
of O
a O
different O
variety O
than O
you O
usually O
see O
in O
the O
depths O
of O
the O
forest O
. O


There O
is O
a O
staircase B-ART
going O
down O
, O
and O
another O
door B-ART
going O
east O
. O


This O
is O
the O
small B-ART
Village I-ART
you O
seem O
to O
lead O
. O
It O
consists O
of O
several O
small B-ART
huts I-ART
, O
plus O
a O
larger O
one O
with O
no O
walls B-ART
the O
People B-ART
use O
as O
a O
meeting B-ART
area I-ART
. O
The O
People B-ART
are O
there O
now O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
arguing O
over O
something O
. O
The O
ground B-ART
slopes O
down O
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
a O
path O
leads O
along O
a O
ridge O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O
A O
small B-ART
stream I-ART
collects O
here O
, O
and O
follows O
the O
slope O
down O
to O
the O
north O
. O


This O
path O
marks O
the O
beginnings O
of O
a O
descent O
down O
into O
the O
local O
canyon O
, O
to O
the O
northeast O
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
a O
small B-ART
ragged I-ART
cliff I-ART
, I-ART
small I-ART
enough O
here O
to O
scale O
, O
but O
which O
becomes O
a O
more O
imposing O
wall B-ART
as O
you O
continue O
your O
descent O
into O
the O
canyon O
. O
A O
small B-ART
stream I-ART
, O
beginning O
to O
show O
life O
again O
after O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
summer O
heat O
, O
follows O
its O
rocky O
bed B-ART
here O
, O
as O
it O
continues O
down O
into O
the O
canyon O
. O


This O
path O
meanders O
northeast O
along O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
small B-ART
cliff I-ART
to O
the O
east O
, O
as O
it O
wends O
its O
way O
amongst O
the O
scrub O
. O
Your O
Village O
is O
back O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
base O
of O
a O
box O
canyon B-ART
. O
Ragged B-ART
walls I-ART
tower B-ART
over O
you O
on O
three O
sides O
, O
striated B-ART
red I-ART
, I-ART
black I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
tan I-ART
. O
The O
small B-ART
stream I-ART
running O
along O
here O
dries O
up O
in O
the O
summer O
, O
but O
is O
now O
still O
active O
. O
A O
crack B-ART
in O
the O
north O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
canyon B-ART
allows O
it O
to O
pass O
along O
its O
path O
from O
the O
Village O
, O
back O
up O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O


The O
stream B-ART
from O
the O
south O
cuts O
through O
the O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
canyon O
here O
, O
and O
runs O
for O
several O
paces O
before O
cascading O
down O
a O
steep B-ART
, I-ART
gravelly I-ART
slope I-ART
. O
The O
sides O
of O
the O
canyon O
provide O
a O
welcome O
shade O
from O
the O
hot O
sun O
, O
which O
apparently O
is O
also O
enjoyed O
by O
a O
small B-ART
grove I-ART
of I-ART
Fruit I-ART
Trees I-ART
, I-ART
clustered I-ART
around O
a O
wide O
section O
of O
the O
stream B-ART
. O


The O
view O
is O
almost O
a O
blur O
around O
you O
, O
as O
Horse B-ART
runs O
frantically O
, O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
off O
his O
back O
. O
Every O
so O
often O
, O
you O
notice O
some O
feature O
of O
the O
landscape B-ART
, O
but O
, O
unsurprisingly O
, O
most O
of O
your O
attention O
is O
on O
Horse B-ART
, O
and O
your O
bumpy O
ride O
. O


Right O
now O
, O
the O
entire O
place O
is O
rather O
deserted O
, O
as O
everyone B-ART
is O
down O
in O
the O
Canyon O
, O
trying O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
ride O
a O
Horse O
like O
you O
did O
. O
The O
ground B-ART
slopes O
down O
to O
the O
northeast O
, O
and O
a O
path O
leads O
along O
a O
ridge O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O
A O
small B-ART
stream I-ART
collects O
here O
, O
and O
follows O
the O
slope O
down O
to O
the O
northeast O
. O


You O
are O
on O
a O
path B-ART
in O
a O
dense O
, O
dark O
forest B-ART
. O
You O
have O
come O
from O
the O
west O
; O
the O
path B-ART
continues O
east O
. O


The O
path B-ART
bends O
northward O
. O
The O
light O
seems O
brighter O
up O
ahead O
. O


In O
the O
clearing O
before O
you O
stands O
a O
tremendous O
tower B-ART
. O
It O
rises O
high O
above O
you O
, O
higher O
than O
you O
can O
see O
. O


You O
see O
no O
entrance O
on O
this O
side O
either O
. O
You O
could O
proceed O
north O
or O
south O
around O
the O
tower B-ART
. O


You O
could O
proceed O
east O
or O
west O
around O
the O
tower B-ART

This O
large O
round O
chamber O
fills O
the O
entire O
first O
level O
of O
the O
tower O
. O
The O
vaulted O
ceiling O
is O
about O
fifty O
feet O
above O
you O
. O
There O
are O
no O
windows O
, O
but O
light O
comes O
from O
white O
lamps B-ART
mounted O
in O
the O
walls O

Polished O
stone O
stairs B-ART
curve O
around O
the O
tower O
wall O
from O
the O
north O
up O
to O

You O
are O
in O
a O

It O
curves O
around O
to O

This O
large O

of O
the O

Arched O
doorways O
lead O

An O

A O

A O
massive O
, O

of O
the O

of O
this O
level O
. O
You O
can O
leave O
through O
a O

This O
square O
chamber O
, O
about O
30 O
feet O
across O
, O
is O
dominated O
by O
a O
large O
waterwheel B-ART
mounted O
on O
the O

wall B-ART
. O
A O
doorway B-ART
leads O
east O
. O


This O

is O
filled O
with O
a O
strange O
apparatus B-ART
. O
All O
around O
you O
is O
a O
network O
of O
scaffolding O
with O
little O
wooden O
water O
channels B-ART
, I-ART
wheels I-ART

rockers I-ART

all O
swishing O

This O
is O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
twenty O
foot O
deep O
pool O
. O
There O
is O
a O
large O
drain B-ART
in O
the O
floor O
. O
Iron B-ART
rungs I-ART
climb O
the O
wall O
. O
A O
low O
passageway O
leads O
south O
. O


This O
looks O
like O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
another O
square B-ART
pool O
, O
almost O
identical O
to O
the O
first O
. O
Rungs B-ART

a O

. O


This O

the O
southwest O
quarter O
. O
Rungs B-ART
lead O
down O
into O
a O
square B-ART
hole I-ART
. O


The O
northern O
exit O
of O
this O
chamber O
is O
blocked O
by O
a O
portcullis B-ART
. O
But O
it O
doesn't O
matter O
, O
because O
there O
is O
also O
a O
small O
secret B-ART
door I-ART
. O


Through O
an O
open O
door B-ART
in O
the O
north O
wall O
, O
stairs B-ART
lead O
up O
. O


You O
are O
wedged O
comfortably O
into O
your O
lair B-ART
, O
relaxing O
in O
the O
cold O
comfort O
of O
a O
stone O
crevice O
, O
the O
walls B-ART
worn O
smooth O
by O
years O
of O
occupation O
. O
Here O
, O
the O
darkness O
is O
complete O
, O
like O
Mother's O
comforting O
, O
opaque O
fur B-ART
. O
No O
luminous O
fungi O
or O
glowing O
worms O
venture O
here O
with O
their O
harsh O
, O
painful O
light O
. O


You O
sense O
a O
tasty O
adventurer B-ART
in O
the O
cavern B-ART
. O


You O
sense O
a O
tasty O
adventurer B-ART
in O
the O
tunnel B-ART
. O


You O
sense O
a O
tasty O
adventurer B-ART
in O
the O
grotto B-ART
. O


You O
sense O
a O
tasty O
adventurer B-ART
in O
the O
hollow B-ART
. O


It O
is O
pitch B-ART
dark O
, O
and O
you O
can't O
see O
a O
thing O
. O
Also O
your O
eyes B-ART
are O
closed O
. O
Which O
is O
fine O
. O
The O
adventurer B-ART
whispers O
into O
the O
darkness O
and O
fumbles O
with O
something O
, O
Please O
light O
. O
Please O
light O
. O
There O
is O
another O
wooden O
scratching O
sound O
. O


You O
sense O
a O
tasty O
adventurer B-ART
in O
the O
pit B-ART
. O


What O
other O
people O
like O
to O
call O
lazy O
, O
you O
like O
to O
consider O
meditative O
; O
it O
shows O
in O
how O
sparsely O
decorated O
your O
room B-ART
is O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
bare O
, O
outside B-ART
of O
a O
shoddy O
closet B-ART
built O
into O
one O
of O
them O
. O
Your O
garage O
sale O
nightstand B-ART
sits O
next O
to O
your O
equally O
impressive O
bed B-ART
, O
bringing O
the O
entire O
motif O
of O
the O
room B-ART
somewhere O
into O
the O
realm O
of O
bachelor O
crap O
hole O
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
your O
living B-ART
room I-ART
, O
and O
west O
is O
the O
entrance O
to O
your O
bathroom B-ART
. O


It O
isn't O
in O
the O
best O
shape O
, O
but O
it O
isn't O
condemned O
either O
mostly O
because O
as O
far O
as O
the O
city O
is O
concerned O
, O
this O
room B-ART
doesn't O
even O
exist O
. O
It O
has O
the O
normal O
bathroom B-ART
fixtures O
; O
a O
shower B-ART
, O
a O
counter B-ART
with O
a O
sink B-ART
and I-ART
mirror I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
toilet I-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
your O
bedroom B-ART
. O


The O
walls O
are O
bare O
, O
outside B-ART
of O
a O
shoddy O
closet B-ART
built O
into O
one O
of O
them O
, O
which O
is O
open O
and O
displaying O
your O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
ratty I-ART
old I-ART
shoes I-ART
and O
your O
work B-ART
clothes I-ART
. O


The O
walls O
are O
bare O
, O

So O
. O
. O
. O
this O
is O
where O
you O
live O
. O
Usually O
, O
you O
only O
leave O
if O
you O
absolutely O
have O
to O
, O
for O
example O
to O
get O
fresh O
supplies O
of O
chemicals O
. O
The O
apartment B-ART
consists O
only O
of O
one O
single O
room O
which O
serves O
as O
living O
room O
, O
bedroom B-ART
, O
kitchen O
and O
even O
bathroom O
combined O
. O
The O
downside O
is O
that O
you O
couldn't O
get O
a O
place O
without O
a O
window B-ART
, O
so O
you're O
not O
safe O
from O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
sun B-ART
in O
here O
. O
The O
regular O
exit O
is O
a O
door B-ART
on O
the O
north O
wall O
. O


Statistically O
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
you've O
entered O
and O
left O
most O
in O
your O
life O
outside B-ART
of O
your O
apartment B-ART
Once O
on O
your O
way O
to O
work O
and O
once O
on O
your O
way O
home O
. O
The O
street O
leads O
west O
to O
the O
university O
where O
you O
work O
and O
east O
to O
the O
city O
centre O
. O
At O
least O
you've O
been O
told O
the O
latter O
when O
you O
moved O
here O
you O
never O
tested O
this O
hypothesis O
. O
The O
sun's B-ART
rays O
, O
reflected O
from O
one O
of O
the O
city's O
shiny O
mail B-ART
tubes I-ART
, O
sting O
in O
your O
eyes O
like O
needles O
. O


Due O
to O
the O
sun's B-ART
glaring O
brightness O
, O
you O
have O
to O
squint O
your O
eyes O
in O
order O
to O
see O
anything O
at O
all O
. O
The O
campus O
consists O
of O
a O
number O
of O
grey B-ART
buildings I-ART
from O
the O
1970s O
. O
You O
can O
see O
the O
building B-ART
you O
used O
to O
work O
in O
to O
the O
west O
. O
A O
path O
leading O
around O
it O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
The O
only O
bearable O
sight O
is O
the O
elegant O
mail B-ART
tube I-ART
emerging O
from O
the O
building B-ART
walls O
. O
Some O
students B-ART
are O
here O
, O
joking O
amongst O
themselves O
and O
laughing O
. O
Without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
target O
of O
their O
laughter O
is O
you O
! O


All O
these O
buildings O
look O
alike O
you O
recognise O
the O
familiar O
hospital O
atmosphere O
. O
An O
office B-ART
door I-ART
welcomes O
you O
to O
the O
west O
. O
The O
windowless O
corridor O
leads O
north O
towards O
your O
old O
workplace O
as O
well O
as O
your O
boss's O
office B-ART
and O
stairs O
allow O
going O
upstairs O
where O
the O
more O
privileged O
members O
of O
the O
department O
work O
. O
The O
building's O
exit O
is O
located O
to O
your O
east O
. O


This O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
an O
office B-ART
? O
It's O
so O
clean O
and O
tidy O
you're O
wondering O
how O
anyone O
could O
possibly O
get O
any O
work O
done O
here O
! O


Since O
all O
these O
corridors O
look O
alike O
, O
you O
have O
put O
a O
mark B-ART
on O
this O
part O
of O
the O
wall B-ART
to O
recognise O
the O
door B-ART
leading O
to O
your O
lab B-ART
which O
can O
be O
found O
in O
the O
north O
wall B-ART
. O
To O
your O
west O
, O
you O
think O
can O
see O
the O
portal B-ART
to O
hell O
the O
door B-ART
of O
your O
boss's B-ART
office O
. O
The O
ceiling B-ART
light I-ART
is O
flickering O
a O
bit O
. O
. O
. O
annoying O
you O
to O
no O
end O
. O


So O
this O
is O
where O
what O
most O
people B-ART
call O
life O
is O
. O
In O
the O
general O
chaos O
of O
people B-ART
walking O
around O
everywhere B-ART
, O
you O
can O
make O
out B-ART
a O
locksmith's B-ART
shop B-ART
to O
the O
south O
, O
a O
pub B-ART
whose O
wall O
is O
sporting O
a O
ventilation B-ART
opening B-ART
to O
the O
east O
and O
a O
hospital B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O
In O
the O
light O
of O
the O
ant O
like O
chaotic O
movement O
of O
the O
people B-ART
, O
the O
only O
thing O
giving O
you O
a O
little O
calm O
is O
the O
regulated O
flow O
of O
the O
mail B-ART
tubes I-ART
leading O
to O
every B-ART
building O
. O
The O
air O
seems O
to O
be O
standing O
completely O
still O
here O
, O
making O
the O
grinding O
heat O
caused O
by O
the O
sun B-ART
even O
worse O
than O
normal O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
you O
hate O
the O
sun B-ART
! O


One O
word O
is O
enough O
to O
describe O
this O
place O
smoke O
. O
Smoke O
is O
what O
you O
see O
, O
smoke O
is O
what O
you O
smell O
and O
if O
smoke O
had O
a O
sound O
, O
you're O
sure O
you'd O
hear O
it O
, O
too O
. O
Tired O
customers B-ART
are O
hunched O
over O
the O
tables B-ART
and O
a O
door B-ART
, O
presumably O
leading O
to O
the O
kitchen B-ART
, O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
north O
wall O
behind B-ART
the O
bar B-ART
. O


You O
sometimes O
heard O
your O
colleagues O
talking O
about O
media O
reports O
about O
unhygienic O
restaurant O
kitchens B-ART
. O
You O
can't O
see O
any O
evidence O
of O
that O
here O
. O
It's O
just O
as O
clean O
as O
your O
own O
home O
! O


The O
hospital B-ART
is O
a O
depressing O
place O
. O
Lots O
of O
ill O
or O
dead O
people O
being O
pushed O
around O
in O
beds B-ART
. O
Signs B-ART
point O
the O
ways O
to O
the O
maternity O
ward O
west O
, O
the O
emergency O
room O
east O
and O
the O
luxurious O
single O
rooms O
for O
the O
not O
really O
very O
ill O
north O
. O
The O
buildings O
exit O
is O
to O
the O
south O
. O


The O
corridor O
ends O
in O
a O
dead O
end O
here O
, O
so O
the O
only O
way O
it O
can O
be O
followed O
is O
to O
the O
south O
. O
Two B-ART
more O
rooms O
are O
located O
east O
and O
west O
. O


The O
upstairs O
corridor B-ART
leads O
north O
to O
the O
department B-ART
door B-ART
. O
Stairs O
are O
leading O
down O
. O


In O
this O
office B-ART
, O
the O
relatively O
speaking O
privileged O
engineers O
usually O
work O
, O
but O
they O
don't O
seem O
to O
be O
here O
right O
now O
. O
A O
door O
is O
embedded O
into O
the O
east O
wall O
, O
a O
window B-ART
in O
the O
west O
wall O
. O
Next O
to O
the O
door O
, O
there O
is O
an O
array O
of O
coat B-ART
hooks I-ART
. O


Quite O
a O
bare O
bone O
room O
, O
but O
at O
least O
the O
engineers O
on O
this O
floor O
have O
a O
break O
room O
at O
all O
. O
In O
the O
corner O
, O
you O
can O
see O
a O
water B-ART
cooler I-ART
. O


You O
sit O
at O
the O
far O
end O
of O
the O
long O
dining O
table O
in O
a O
kind O
of O
dock B-ART
, O
carefully O
fenced O
in O
with O
a O
quadrilateral O
of O
light O
bedroom O
chairs B-ART
, O
any O
of O
which O
you O
could O
toss O
out B-ART
the O
window O
with O
your O
big O
toe O
. O
You O
have O
been O
provided O
with O
pens B-ART
and I-ART
paper I-ART
. O
So O
far O
you O
have O
made O
paper B-ART
boats I-ART
, O
paper B-ART
darts I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
paper I-ART
dolls I-ART
contentedly O
throughout O
the O
whole O
proceedings O
. O
You O
are O
as O
unconscious O
as O
a O
child O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
an O
empty O
nursery O
, O
and O
are O
in O
fact O
so O
absorbed O
that O
you O
don't O
seem O
to O
see O
or O
hear O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
room O
. O


The O
sea B-ART
itself O
looks O
like O
absinthe O
, O
green B-ART
and O
bitter O
and O
poisonous O
. O
In O
the O
sky B-ART
is O
that O
early O
and O
stormy O
darkness O
that O
is O
so O
depressing O
to O
the O
mind O
, O
and O
the O
wind O
blows O
shrilly O
round O
a O
little O
lonely O
coloured O
kiosk O
where O
they O
sell O
newspapers O
, O
and O
along O
the O
hills O
of O
sand O
by O
the O
shore B-ART
. O


A O
small O
French O
cafe B-ART
sits O
quiet O
by O
the O
waves O
. O
West O
lies O
the O
sea O
. O
It O
is O
late O
afternoon O
, O
and O
the O
tables B-ART
and I-ART
chairs I-ART
are O
all O
empty O
. O


You O
stand O
on O
a O
lonely O
train B-ART
platform I-ART
under O
a O
cold O
, O
greenish B-ART
evening O
sky B-ART
. O
A O
little O
snow O
has O
fallen O
, O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
whiten O
the O
plain O
, O
which O

away O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
sad O
purple O
in O

save O
where O
the O
flat O
tops O
of O
some O
distant O
tablelands O
catch O
the O
evening O
light O

Farther O
north O
, O
you O
see O
a O
knot O
of O
rowdies O
, O
the O
embers O
of O
a O
recent O
train B-ART
strike O
. O
They O
don't O
look O

You O
stand O
on O
the O
far O
end O
of O
the O
platform B-ART

alone O
in O
this O

with O
the O

You O

In O
the O
dead O
of O
night O

the O
haze O
, O
the O
wall B-ART
is O
eerie O
in O
the O
shadows O
of O
the O
trees B-ART
, O
but O
it O
looks O
just O
wide O
enough O
to O
walk O
on O

You O
climb O
the O
ladder B-ART

walk O
along O
the O

Hawkins B-ART
realizes O
where O
he O
is O

stops O

The O
garden B-ART
wall I-ART
is O
narrow O
, O
but O
an O
excellent O
right B-ART
of I-ART

with O
chimney B-ART
pots I-ART
here O
and O
there O
that O
seem O
in O
the O
haze O
as O
bulky O
as O
small O

. O


The O
floor O
is O
bare O
in O
this O
attic B-ART

whomever O
it O
may O
belong O

and O
the O
darkness B-ART

intense O

The O

You've O
had O
this O
place O
redecorated O
a O
few O
times O
. O
Eleanor B-ART
has O
been O
good O
enough O
to O
keep O
the O
paints O
downstairs O
, O
which O
has O
prevented O
any O
inadvertant O
graffiti O
. O
Although O
she O
sometimes O
threatens O
to O
paint O
in O
bed B-ART
when O
you've O
been O
annoying O
her O
, O
and O
that O
sends O
shivers O
down O
your O
spine O
. O
At O
present O
, O
the O
ceiling B-ART
is O
awash O
with O
silver O
stars O
against O
a O
blue B-ART
sky O
, O
while O
the O
bed B-ART
and I-ART
dresser I-ART
are O
coloured O
purple O
and O
gold O
for O
contrast O
. O
The O
carpet B-ART
is O
a O
pleasant O
green B-ART
. O
Since O
the O
last O
change O
Eleanor B-ART
keeps O
complaining O
about O
headaches O
in O
a O
pointed O
fashion O
, O
and O
you're O
on O
the O
point O
of O
caving O
and O
having O
it O
changed O
to O
something O
more O
pedestrian O
. O
But O
it'd O
be O
a O
shame O
, O
you O
spent O
days O
working O
it O
all O
out B-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
room O
to O
pass O
through O
. O
Thus O
, O
you've O
made O
sure O
to O
fill O
it O
with O
things O
that O
you O
need O
to O
remember O
, O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
they'll O
catch O
your O
eye O
at O
the O
right O
time O
. O
At O
the O
moment O
, O
you O
have O
a O
pair O
of O
frames B-ART
hanging O
on O
the O
wall O
, O
one O
containing O
a O
diagram B-ART
, O
and O
the O
other O
some O
pressed B-ART
leaves I-ART
. O


Eleanor's O
works B-ART
are O
arrayed O
here O
. O
She O
spent O
some O
time O
making O
sure O
they O
were O
all O
hanging O
at O
the O
same O
level O
, O
and O
the O
effect O
is O
striking O
. O
You O
haven't O
been O
able O
to O
do O
the O
same O
for O
the O
landing O
. O


You've O
taken O
to O
avoiding O
this O
room O
recently O
. O
Your O
desk B-ART
has O
started O
to O
seem O
menacing O
. O
Aside O
from O
that O
, O
you've O
got O
a O
chair B-ART
, O
and O
a O
shelf B-ART
which O
you O
use O
to O
keep O
work B-ART
related O
items O
. O


Dwarven O
tents B-ART
are O
short O
and O
stout O
. O
They're O
also O
fairly O
resilient O
. O


You're O
lost O
. O
The O
path O
has O
faded O
away O
, O
and O
there's O
an O
awful O
lack O
of O
points O
of O
reference O
. O
You O
notice O
birds B-ART
flying O
above O
you O
, O
and O
feel O
envious O
. O


Without O
the O
plants O
, O
the O
field O
looks O
desolate O
. O
The O
only O
other O
feature O
is O
a O
rugged B-ART
looking O
tree B-ART
, O
with O
an O
enormous O
pile O
of O
weird B-ART
pods I-ART
lying O
at O
its O
feet O
. O


You O
can't O
see O
anything O
new O
about O
the O
situation O
, O
although O
the O
brightness O
of O
the O
sun B-ART
becomes O
more O
noticable O
. O


You O
stand O
amidst O
the O
remains B-ART
of O
the O
plants B-ART
, O
and O
feel O
a O
strange O
vibration O
through O
your O
feet O
. O


You O
imagined O
that O
you O
could O
display O
your O
own O
work O
here O
, O
but O
that O
hasn't O
quite O
worked O
out B-ART
. O
As O
is O
, O
there's O
a O
collection B-ART
of O
your O
inspirations B-ART
, O
to O
which O
you O
frequently O
return O
. O


Stairs B-ART
above O
you O
lead O
back O
to O
the O
surface O
. O
Stairs B-ART
below O
you O
lead O
nowhere O
, O
having O
collapsed O
into O
a O
pit B-ART
. O
Around O
you O
, O
is O
a O
small O
cave O
. O


This O
is O
a O
wide O
area O
, O
filled O
with O
goblins B-ART
, O
all O
hard O
at O
work O
with O
their O
mining B-ART
. O
You're O
glad O
your O
gear O
includes O
a O
helmet O
. O


While O
there O
aren't O
actually O
any O
goblins O
sleeping O
here O
right O
now O
, O
you O
can O
recognise O
the O
function O
of O
the O
place O
from O
the O
crude B-ART
beds I-ART
scattered O
around O
. O


Whatever O
you've O
heard O
about O
goblins O
, O
this O
room O
is O
very O
neatly O
organised O
. O
Everything B-ART
is O
locked O
in O
labelled O
boxes O
. O
Except O
for O
a O
single O
ladder B-ART
, O
which O
is O
presumably O
because O
of O
its O
great O
height O
. O


The O
chamber O
is O
filled O
with O
shrieking B-ART
goblins I-ART
, O
waving O
their O
hands O
in O
the O
air O
aimlessly O
. O
You O
can O
just O
about O
hear O
some O
drumming O
from O
the O
north O
end O
, O
and O
just O
about O
see O
a O
goblin O
wearing O
brightly O
coloured O
clothes O
. O


Up O
here O
, O
you've O
got O
a O
much O
better O
view O
. O
You O
can O
see O
a O
goblin B-ART
dressed O
in O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
monk's O
robe O
, O
but O
made O
from O
a O
dazzling O
yellow O
cloth O
. O
He O
is O
beating O
a O
pair O
of O
drums O
. O


Here O
, O
you O
stand O
in O
a O
small O
circle O
surrounding O
the O
goblin B-ART
drummer I-ART
, O
surrounded O
itself O
by O
an O
impassable O
throng O
of O
goblins B-ART
. O
Neither O
the O
drummer B-ART
nor O
his O
audience O
are O
paying O
you O
any O
attention O
. O


About O
you O
are O
four O
passageways O
. O
You O
sense O
the O
majesty O
of O
the O
king O
to O
the O
north O
, O
the O
smallness O
of O
the O
servants O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
the O
outer B-ART
sanctum O
to O
the O
east O
. O


Here O
, O
the O
servants B-ART
have O
been O
placed O
. O
Each B-ART
of O
them O
has O
a O
task O
to O
perform O
for O
the O
king O
in O
the O
underworld O
. O
You O
remember O
their O
joy O
as O
they O
were O
chosen O
. O


The O
mystic B-ART
light O
is O
weaker O
here O
, O
and O
there O
are O
many O
shadows B-ART
. O
You O
wonder O
what O
went O
wrong O
during O
the O
rituals O
. O


An O
entry O
room O
. O
Now O
that O
the O
thieves O
have O
fled O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
remaining O
is O
a O
strange O
machine B-ART
that O
they O
brought O
with O
them O
. O
Sadly O
, O
they've O
made O
off O
with O
some O
minor O
treasures O
, O
but O
at O
least O
the O
peace O
has O
been O
restored O
. O


With O
some O
difficulty O
, O
you O
managed O
to O
acquire O
a O
table B-ART
that O
was O
precisely O
the O
correct O
size O
. O
Eleanor O
and O
you O
can O
quite O
comfortably O
talk O
across O
it O
between O
mouthfuls O
. O
You've O
filled O
the O
walls O
with O
portraits B-ART
of O
various O
dignitaries O
in O
preparation O
for O
receiving O
guests O
. O
Under O
which O
circumstances O
you'll O
have O
to O
bring O
up O
the O
other O
table B-ART
currently O
residing O
in O
the O
cellar O
. O


This O
rock O
has O
a O
lightning B-ART
rod I-ART
set O
into O
to O
it O
. O
As O
you O
might O
expect O
, O
the O
rod B-ART
has O
a O
halo B-ART
of O
electricity O
continously O
washing O
around O
it O
. O
Fortunately O
, O
ielectricity O
isn't O
too O
dangerous O
to O
you O
, O
you O
can O
touch O
it O
safely O
. O


A O
rainbow B-ART
ends O
here O
, O
coming O
in O
from O
the O
west O
. O


Differently O
coloured O
clouds B-ART
float O
around O
you O
. O
This O
place O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
type O
of O
attractor O
for O
them O
. O


There's O
still O
some O
of O
the O
electric O
halo B-ART
hanging O
around O
hopefully O
, O
but O
the O
majority O
of O
it O
has O
vanished O
. O


Your O
rock O
is O
a O
simple O
one O
, O
without O
luxury O
. O
Your O
stuff B-ART
lies O
around O
you O
. O


That's O
unusual O
. O
There's O
an O
airship B-ART
crashed I-ART
here O
. O
There O
must O
have O
been O
some O
especially O
thick O
cloud B-ART
cover O
recently O
. O
And O
you O
suppose O
that O
this O
particular O
rock O
is O
pretty O
large O
. O


There O
are O
still O
a O
few O
bits B-ART
and I-ART
pieces I-ART
lying O
around O
. O


Here O
, O
there O
is O
a O
dragon B-ART
. O
A O
silver B-ART
one O
. O
You O
feel O
unnerved O
by O
its O
presence O
. O
And O
what's O
it O
doing O
here O
? O
And O
he's O
got O
a O
hoard B-ART
of I-ART
treasure I-ART
. O


The O
daemons O
keep O
this O
room O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O
You O
have O
to O
pay O
them O
for O
the O
service O
of O
course O
, O
but O
it's O
definitely O
worth O
it O
. O
As O
you O
might O
expect O
, O
there's O
a O
toilet B-ART
, O
a O
sink B-ART
and O
a O
bath B-ART
. O
You O
considered O
getting O
a O
shower O
, O
but O
that O
seems O
a O
bit O
too O
modern O
for O
the O
general O
theme O
you've O
established O
. O
Oh O
yes O
, O
there's O
also O
a O
mechanical B-ART
musician B-ART
in O
the O
corner O
. O


The O
culprit B-ART
of O
the O
crimes O
is O
trapped B-ART
in O
front O
of O
you O
, O
in O
the O
sphere B-ART
that O
Eleanor O
painted O
. O
He O
glares O
at O
you O
, O
but O
you O
sense O
that O
he O
is O
powerless O
to O
do O
anything O
. O


Cabin B-ART

You O

lit O
by O
the O

glowing O
through O
a O

A O

Except O
for O
the O

throwing O
you O
out O

His O

Aaieeee O

I'm O

the O

Crulley B-ART
drags O
you O
, O
despite O
your O

towards O
him B-ART

Then O
suddenly O
he O
grunts O
, O
stiffens O
and O
slumps O
into O

Stunned O
, O
Crulley B-ART

his O

A O

form O
blocks O
the O

, O
one O
fist O
still O
raised O
from O

your O

. O
You O
catch O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
hard O
masculinity O
of O
his O
broad O
shoulders O
, O
the O
implied O
power O
in O
the O
scar O
that O
etches O
the O
stranger's O
jaw O
, O
and O
feel O
tremors O
course O
through O

Then O
you O
realize O
how O
ragged O
are O
his O
shirt O
, O
patched O

and O
high O

. O
Intuitively O
, O
you O
understand O
he O
is O
the O

Alas O

Your O

Yes O

You O

The O

glances O

then O
notices O
the O
coffer B-ART

Davis's B-ART
safety O
box B-ART
my O
men B-ART
were O
hoping O
I'd O
find O
it O
. O
He O
takes O
it O
and O
nudges O
the O
unconscious O
man B-ART
on O
the O
floor O
, O
I O
wonder O
how O
Crulley B-ART
knew O
you O
were O
here O
? O
Just O
his O
bad O
luck O
? O
He'll O
be O
flogged O
when O
he O
wakes O
. O
The O

bows O
. O
My O
lady O
, O
may O
I O
offer O
my O
protection O
and O
my O
ship B-ART
until O
your O
father B-ART

He O
has O
a O

Beside O
an O
open O
crack B-ART
in O
the O
floor O
stands O
a O
glinting B-ART
beast B-ART
, O
the O
centerpiece O
of O
this O
dusty B-ART
vault B-ART
. O
Its O
glassy O
eyes B-ART
and O
shiny O
skin B-ART
reflect O
a O
sliver B-ART
of I-ART
light I-ART
beneath O
a O
huge B-ART
western I-ART
door I-ART
. O
Various O
cartons B-ART
and I-ART
barrels I-ART
are O
stacked B-ART
against O
the O
opposite O
wall B-ART
. O


Its O
glassy O
eyes B-ART
and O
shiny O
skin B-ART
reflect O
the O
sunlight O
that O
streams O
through O
an O
opening O
to O
the O
west O
. O


Suspended O
by O
runners B-ART
on O
either O
side O
, O
the O
huge B-ART
door I-ART
lies O
flat O
. O
There's O
enough O
space O
to O
walk O
on O
top O
of O
it O
, O
although O
the O
ceiling B-ART
is O
damp O
and O
cluttered O
with O
cobwebs B-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
something O
glimmers O
on O
a O
shadowy B-ART
shelf I-ART
. O


Stack B-ART
upon O
stack B-ART
, I-ART
row I-ART
upon O
row B-ART
, O
of O
flat B-ART
, I-ART
shiny I-ART
eggs I-ART
crowd O
this O
dark O
shelf B-ART
. O
The O
eggs B-ART
shimmer O
like O
magic O
vessels O
. O
You O
can't O
help O
but O
contemplate O
their O
sealed O
contents O
. O


From O
the O
inner O
sill B-ART
of O
a O
window B-ART
, O
you O
look O
east O
over O
a O
snowy B-ART
landscape I-ART
. O


The O
sky B-ART
never O
seemed O
so O
vast O
, O
the O
wind O
so O
angry O
, O
the O
ground O
so O
remote O
. O
Facing O
upwards O
, O
you O
cling O
with O
all O
four O
claws B-ART
to O
a O
slender O
trunk O
. O
West O
of O
you O
, O
the O
winds O
whistles O
through O
an O
open O
window B-ART
. O
Water B-ART
rushes O
far O
below O
, O
but O
you O
can O
hardly O
bear O
to O
look O
. O


The O
pitched O
roof B-ART
of O
the O
Provider's O
cottage B-ART
affords O
an O
excellent O
view O
of O
the O
surrounding O
valley B-ART
. O
A O
stream B-ART
winds O
through O
forest B-ART
to O
the O
east O
and O
south O
, O
while O
a O
woodland B-ART
trail I-ART
to O
the O
west O
links O
scattered O
farmhouses B-ART
, O
such O
as O
the O
neighboring B-ART
one O
beyond O
a O
fence B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


Here O
the O
Provider B-ART
divines O
food B-ART
from O
the O
cupboard's B-ART
magic O
containers B-ART
, O
and O
prepares O
it O
on O
the O
ledge B-ART
like O
only O
a O
Provider B-ART
can O
. O


Within O
the O
close O
, O
heavy O
shadows O
, O
it's O
difficult O
to O
separate O
the O
commingled O
scents O
. O
Most O
of O
the O
arranged O
boxes B-ART
appear O
to O
contain O
a O
Provider B-ART
version O
of O
hard B-ART
food I-ART
. O
Indeed O
, O
your O
very O
own O
monstrous B-ART
sack I-ART
of I-ART
hard I-ART
food I-ART
stands O
nearby O
. O


There O
is O
just O
enough O
room O
in O
this O
cozy O
corner O
for O
the O
lumpy B-ART
mountain I-ART
and O
the O
confusing B-ART
black I-ART
box I-ART
that O
faces O
it O
. O
The O
lumpy B-ART
mountain I-ART
is O
home O
to O
some O
of O
your O
finest O
claw B-ART
and I-ART
scratch I-ART
marks I-ART
, O
though O
your O
Provider O
has O
never O
shared O
much O
enthusiasm O
for O
the O
art O
. O
The O
scent O
of O
your O
food O
bowl O
wafts O
in O
from O
the O
west O
. O


Its O
glassy O
eyes B-ART
and O
shiny O
skin B-ART
reflect O
the O
moonlight O
that O
streams O
through O
an O
opening O
to O
the O
west O
. O


Shiny O
, O
intertwined B-ART
tubes B-ART
presumably O
his O
exposed O
entrails B-ART
hang O
from O
the O
underside B-ART
of O
the O
beast B-ART
. O
From O
one O
of O
his O
stomachs B-ART
, O
he O
slowly O
bleeds O
. O


A O
north O
south O
trail B-ART
runs O
beneath O
a O
canopy B-ART
of I-ART
chestnut I-ART
trees I-ART
. O
You've O
seen O
giant O
glinting B-ART
beasts I-ART
stampede O
here O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
mornings O
and O
evenings O
. O
A O
lesser B-ART
track I-ART
leads O
east O
. O


The O
gray O
walls B-ART
of O
your O
home B-ART
look O
as O
depressing O
as O
they O
always O
do O
. O
You've O
lived O
in O
this O
same O
place O
since O
you O
were O
a O
child O
, O
when O
your O
parents O
escaped O
the O
Exodus O
from O
the O
lost O
regions O
of O
the O
Underworld O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
you O
have O
had O
to O
sell O
many O
of O
your O
personal O
belongings O
in O
order O
to O
stay O
well O
fed O
. O
Consequently O
, O
the O
only O
items O
of O
any O
worth O
left O
here O
are O
a O
rumpled O
bed B-ART
, O
a O
wooden O
cabinet B-ART
, O
and O
a O
table B-ART
that O
you O
use O
both O
for O
eating O
and O
other O
miscellaneous O
tasks O
. O
The O
only O
exit O
from O
your O
home B-ART
is O
the O
doorway O
to O
the O
north O
. O


Leading O
through O
the O
oddly O
shaped O
homes B-ART
and I-ART
workplaces I-ART
of O
the O
village O
of O
Thran B-ART
, O
this O
pathway B-ART
looks O
very O
well O
used O
. O
One O
major O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
that O
this O
is O
also O
the O
most O
well O
lit O
spot O
in O
this O
area O
of O
the O
Underworld O
, O
due O
to O
the O
Circle B-ART
of I-ART
Life I-ART
which O
exists O
just O
over O
this O
point O
. O
Your O
unassuming O
home O
opens O
to O
the O
south O
, O
and O
a O
structure B-ART
exuding O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
heat O
lies O
to O
the O
north O
. O
This O
roadway B-ART
extends O
from O
the O
west O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
massive O
circular O
tower B-ART
is O
very O
cluttered O
, O
due O
to O
an O
amazing O
lack O
of O
space O
. O
The O
reason O
for O
this O
absence O
of O
space O
stands O
in O
the O
center O
of O
this O
chamber B-ART
a O
massive O
telescope B-ART
. O
Garthan B-ART
has O
been O
working O
with O
this O
contraption O
for O
years O
now O
, O
performing O
his O
own O
odd O
form O
of O
astrology O
. O
A O
wooden O
staircase B-ART
winds O
its O
way O
around O
the O
of O
the O
tower B-ART
, O
leading O
to O
the O
top O
. O


The O
round O
houses B-ART
that O
distinctly O
mark O
Thran B-ART
fade O
away O
a O
little O
here O
, O
for O
the O
main O
section O
of O
the O
city B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
west O
. O
The O
sunlight B-ART
let O
in O
by O
the O
Circle B-ART
of I-ART
Life I-ART
casts O
many O
eerie B-ART
shadows I-ART
on O
the O
ground B-ART
here O
. O
Combined O
with O
the O
almost O
complete O
lack O
of O
noise O
, O
this O
area O
makes O
you O
a O
bit O
uneasy O
. O
The O
dirt O
path B-ART
you O
are O
on O
winds O
from O
the O
northeast O
to O
the O
west O
. O


Standing O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
river B-ART
Hajalli I-ART
, O
you O
can O
see O
for O
a O
long O
distance O
in O
both O
directions O
along O
the O
course O
of O
the O
raging O
waters B-ART
. O
All O
of O
your O
life B-ART
you O
have O
been O
warned O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
river B-ART
, O
for O
indeed O
several O
tragic O
drownings O
have O
occurred O
in O
the O
history O
of O
Thran O
. O
The O
only O
well O
worn O
path B-ART
from O
this O
area O
leads O
away O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O


From O
the O
northwest O
a O
dull O
chanting O
pervades O
this O
point B-ART
. O
The O
roadway B-ART
leading O
from O
the O
east O
divides O
into O
two B-ART
smaller O
paths B-ART
here O
, O
a O
more O
well O
used O
one O
to O
the O
northwest O
, O
and O
a O
run O
down O
one O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
A O
brisk O
wind O
floats O
in O
from O
the O
southwest O
, O
making O
this O
area O
a O
bit O
chilly O
. O


The O
stone O
roadway B-ART
which O
intrudes O
from O
the O
northeast O
gradually O
fades O
into O
a O
rock O
strewn O
dirt O
path B-ART
in O
this O
area B-ART
. O
Few O
people O
travel O
in O
this O
direction O
, O
except O
those O
either B-ART
taking O
a O
shortcut O
to O
the O
farther O
stretches O
of O
the O
fungal O
fields O
to O
the O
northwest O
or O
those O
few O
souls O
daring O
to O
journey O
into O
the O
lost O
regions O
of O
the O
Underworld O
to O
the O
south O
. O
The O
sunlight B-ART
coming O
from O
Circle B-ART
to O
the O
northeast O
begins O
to O
be O
blocked O
in O
places O
at O
this O
point O
, O
for O
the O
walls B-ART
of O
the O
passageway O
grow O
a O
bit O
tighter O
, O
particularly O
to O
the O
south O
. O


The O
stone B-ART
walls I-ART
close O
in O
on O
this O
path B-ART
here O
almost O
to O
the O
point O
of O
eliminating O
it O
. O
Very O
little O
light O
is O
let O
into O
this O
crevice O
. O
Just O
enough O
illumination O
exists O
, O
however O
, O
for O
you O
to O
read O
the O
words B-ART
above O
the O
southern O
tunnel B-ART
into O
the O
rock B-ART
. O
Otherwise O
, O
you O
can O
move O
to O
a O
less O
claustrophobic O
space O
to O
the O
north O

The O
Carnival O

it O
at O

A O

blows O
a O

of O
flyers O
and O
some O
broken O

The O
absence O
of O
voices O
and O
laughter O
is O
highly O
apparent O
, O
although O
it O
seems O
that O
someone O
has O
left O
some O
of O
that O
cheery O
circus O
music O
on O

However O
, O
it O
seems O
out B-ART
of O

in O
the O
dark O

Some O
of O
the O

flicker O
above O
you O

The O
shacks O
of O
the O
Midway O
have O
already O
been O
partially O
assembled O

The O

aren't O
that O
impressive O
, O
however O
, O
even O
in O
their O
broken O
down O

. O
Colored O

are O
hanging O
loosely O
by O

A O

You O
can O
see O
the O
looming O
shape O
of O
the O
Green O
Tent B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


The O
Green B-ART
Tent I-ART
is O
a O
great O
domed O
creation O
with O
two B-ART
horn O
like O
projections O
from O
the O
top O
. O
They O
seemed O
to O
be O
suspended O
in O
the O
air O
, O
defying O
gravity O
and O
swaying O
gently O
in O
the O
wind O
. O
You O
wonder O
briefly O
how O
the O
tent B-ART
could O
be O
constructed O
to O
support O
that O
. O
There O
is O
a O
large O
round O
opening O
as O
an O
entrance O
to O
the O
tent B-ART
. O
The O
dirt O
outside B-ART
is O
heavily O
trampled O
, O
indicating O
its O
popularity O
. O
North O
from O
here O
is O
a O
squat O
building O
and O
to O
the O
west O
, O
there O
is O
a O
Purple O
Tent B-ART
. O


It O
is O
a O
cheap O
desk B-ART
. O
Guess O
Li O
ain't O
the O
kind O
of O
guy O
to O
care O
about O
what O
other O
people O
think O
. O
. O
. O
. O
Or O
the O
Ringmaster O
is O
a O
super O
Scrooge O
. O
And O
uh O
, O
there's O
not O
even O
a O
drawer O
. O
. O
. O
The O
circus O
must O
be O
worse O
off O
than O
you O
thought O
. O


The O
Steel O
Platform O
is O
only O
a O
couple O
of O
feet O
long O
and O
even O
shorter O
in O
width O
. O
It O
makes O
your O
stomach O
queasy O
. O
Ignoring O
your O
natural O
instinct O
of O
survival O
, O
you O
look O
around O
enough O
to O
see O
the O
entirety O
of O
the O
Green O
Tent B-ART
here O
. O


It O
is O
a O
short O
, O
squat O
building O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
part O
of O
the O
fairgrounds O
, O
and O
not O
actually O
owned O
by O
the O
circus O
. O
The O
words O
TECHNICAL O
SERVICE O
have O
been O
stenciled O
unevenly O
on O
the O
side O
. O
This O
place O
just O
keeps O
getting O
better O
and O
better O
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
you O
can O
see O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
horse O
corral O
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
there O
is O
the O
Black O
Tent B-ART
. O


It O
is O
a O
small O
, O
violet O
tent B-ART
made O
of O
a O
thick O
, O
sparkly O
velour O
. O
This O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
fortune O
teller's O
tent B-ART
. O
It O
smells O
thickly O
of O
flowers O
and O
chai O
tea O
, O
although O
it's O
not O
an O
altogether O
unpleasant O
scent O
. O
The O
fortune O
teller O
is O
here O
. O
She O
is O
a O
small O
, O
quiet O
young O
woman B-ART
. O
There O
seems O
to O
be O
something O
sad O
about O
her O
, O
but O
she O
has O
a O
perpetually O
fierce O
, O
defensive O
expression O
on O
her O
face O
. O


The O
horse B-ART
corral O
is O
circluar O
in O
shape O
, O
and O
a O
beautiful O
, O
dark O
beast O
runs O
energetically O
. O
There O
are O
two B-ART
sets O
of O
concentric O
fences O
. O
The O
inner O
circle O
keeps O
the O
horse B-ART
contained O
. O
There O
aren't O
any O
additional O
buildings O
here O
. O
You O
wonder O
where O
the O
stunt O
rider O
keeps O
any O
of O
her O
possessions O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
at O
the O
west O
end O
of O
a O
wide O
, O
oval O
, O
rickety O
, O
wooden O
roller O
coaster O
. O
This O
hunk O
a O
junk O
has O
seen O
better O
days O
. O
There's O
not O
a O
lot O
to O
see O
here O
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
where O
you O
can O
board O
the O
coaster O
, O
and O
to O
the O
south O
there's O
the O
Black O
Tent B-ART
. O


The O
Black O
Tent B-ART
is O
wide O
and O
open O
. O
It O
smells O
of O
soap O
and O
raw O
meat O
. O
To O
the O
north O
is O
the O
back O
of O
the O
rollercoaster O
, O
and O
to O
the O
east O
there O
is O
the O
House O
of O
Mirrors O
. O


The O
tent's B-ART
huge O
, O
billowing O
sides O
flap O
gently O
in O
the O
breeze O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
made O
of O
silk O
you O
can O
almost O
hear O
how O
soft O
the O
material O
is O
in O
the O
air O
. O
Beyond O
it O
, O
you O
can O
see O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
horse O
corral O
. O


This O
short O
corridor O
, O
running O
from O
west O
to O
east O
, O
certainly O
would O
not O
look O
out B-ART
of O
place O
in O
a O
5 O
star O
hotel O
or O
an O
old O
mansion O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
reddish O
brown O
and O
the O
floor O
and O
ceiling B-ART
are O
wheat O
colored O
. O
A O
door B-ART
is O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
another O
to O
the O
east O
. O
On O
the O
northern O
wall O
are O
two B-ART
doors I-ART
, O
one O
of O
them O
to O
the O
west O
, O
labeled O
Bedroom B-ART
and O
the O
other O
one O
to O
the O
east O
, O
labeled O
Study B-ART
. O
A O
small O
picture B-ART
hangs O
on O
the O
southern O
wall O
, O
livening O
up O
the O
room O
. O


Moonlight O
shines O
through O
the O
window O
, O
illuminating O
the O
bed B-ART
upon O
which O
your O
' O
owner' B-ART
Tim B-ART
, O
lies O
sleeping O
. O


This O
place O
is O
exactly O
like O
the O
bedroom O
of O
Tim O
, O
except O
larger O
. O
Another O
point O
of O
significant O
difference O
is O
the O
vcr B-ART
tv O
combination B-ART
which O
is O
currently O
the O
focus O
of O
your O
interest O
. O


The O
barren O
walls B-ART
, O
the O
scattered O
books B-ART
, O
and O
the O
splendid O
view O
of O
sunlight O
coming O
through O
the O
window B-ART
fills O
you O
with O
a O
wonderful O
feeling O
of O
being O
back B-ART
where O
you O
belong O
. O


Here O
you O
find O
yourself O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
short O
flight O
of O
stairs B-ART
. O
If O
you O
didn't O
live O
here O
, O
the O
many O
doors B-ART
extending O
from O
here O
might O
seem O
intimidating O
. O
However O
, O
daily O
routine O
reminds O
you O
that O
your O
room O
is O
to O
the O
east O
, O
your O
brothers' B-ART
rooms O
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
the O
bathroom B-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O
A O
stairway O
leads O
back O
down O
. O


Funny O
thing O
, O
it O
is O
the O
upstairs O
bathroom B-ART
is O
actually O
clean O
for O
once O
. O
Indeed O
, O
it O
is O
usually O
quite O
cluttered O
, O
being O
in O
a O
more O
remote O
part O
of O
the O
house O
that's O
rarely O
visited O
by O
parents O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
Mom O
has O
stopped O
by O
recently O
, O
however O
. O
The O
only O
exit O
is O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You're O
in O
the O
main O
hallway O
. O
East O
is O
the O
front O
door B-ART
very O
useful O
for O

. O
The O
kitchen O
is O
north O
, O
the O
master O
bedroom O
is O
to O
the O
south O
, O
the O
living O
room O
is O
just O
to O
the O
west O
of O
you O
, O
and O
stairs O
lead O
to O
higher O
grounds O
. O


This O
is O
the O
center O
of O
the O
house O
. O
There O
are O
a O
few O
pictures B-ART
hanging O
on O
the O
wall B-ART
that O
add O
to O
the O
atmosphere O
. O
A O
soft O
light O
enters O
through O
the O
windows B-ART
, O
filling O
the O
room O
with O
a O
pleasant O
glow O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
main O
hallway O
. O
The O

room O
is O
to O
the O

This O
serves O
as O
Mom O

There's O
a O
big B-ART

You O
realise O
that O
this O

the O
scene B-ART

the O

You're O
not O
sure O
if O
the O

if O
the O

The O

a O
long O

hilarious O

to O
the O

of O
the O
clan B-ART
in O
broken O

The O
rest O
of O
the O

laughing O
uproariously O
and O
pouring O
beer O
over O

Cecil B-ART

sitting O
at O
a O

The O
club O

is O
small O
but O
well O
appointed O
plush O
carpets O
, O
expensive O
furniture O
, O
the O
lot O
. O
You O
suspect O
that O
an O
interior O
decorator O
once O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
, O
effort O
and O
money O
to O
achieve O
this O
professional O
and O
fashionable O
effect O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
his O
or O
her O
efforts O
have O
been O
ruined O
by O
the O
pilots O
, O
who O
over O
the O
years O
have O
covered O
the O
walls O
with O
a O
number O
of O
posters B-ART
completely O
ruining O
the O
colour O
scheme O
. O
The O
sounds O
of O
the O
partying O
occurring O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
clubhouse O
are O
muffled O
here O
a O
blessing O
for O
anyone O
intending O
to O
get O
serious O
work O

The O
cabin B-ART

fairly O
non B-ART

quite O
small B-ART

a O

a O

a O
hideous B-ART
abstract I-ART

on O
the O

an O
immense B-ART
potted I-ART
plant I-ART
by O
the O

Since O
there O
are O
no O
windows O
you O
guess O
you O
must O
be O
on O
the O
lower O

of O
the O

a O

Porter O
Square O
Station B-ART
is O
vast O

deep O
, O
like O
some O
colossal O
cave O
discovered B-ART
beneath O
the O

hewn O
into O
a O
great O
dome B-ART

The O
walls B-ART
are O
smooth O
and O
red O
, O
like O
clay B-ART
, O
but O
the O
whole O
station B-ART
is O
full O
of O
the O
smell O
of O
hot O
plasteel B-ART
, O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
T O
. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

a O
large O

The O
escalators B-ART
curve O
up O
and O
around O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
dome B-ART
, O
slowly O
carrying O
you O
up O
toward O
the O
surface O
. O
The O
station's B-ART
prism B-ART
was O
designed O
to O
illuminate O
the O
platform O
, O
and O
as O
you O
rise O
past O
the O
area O
of O
its O
focus O
the O
whole O
grows O
dimmer O
. O
The O
muted O
grey O
dusk O
of O
the O
surface O
world O
, O
once O
smothered O
by O
the O
artificial O
light B-ART
, O
slowly O
takes O
precedence O
and O
becomes O
the O
sole O
source O
of O
illumination O

The O
station's B-ART
aboveground O
enclosure O
is O
tiny O
compared O
to O
its O
cavernous O

The O
escalators B-ART
exit O
into O
a O
square O
greenhouse B-ART

about O
twelve O

The O

you O
can O
still O
see O
some O
of O
the O

through O
them O

Heavy O
doors B-ART
lead O
out O

It's O
caked O

they're O
all O
old O
buildings B-ART

unadorned O
, O
apart O
from O
a O
decrepit O

covering O
the O
stone B-ART
floor O

The O
small O
amount O
of O
light B-ART
entering O
through O
the O
window B-ART
does O
little O
to O
disperse O
the O
depressing O
atmosphere O
created O
by O
the O
dark O
wooden B-ART
panelling O
that O
covers O
the O

the O
large B-ART

The O

The O
gentle O
sound O
of O
snow B-ART
against O
the O

that O
it's O
cold O
outside O

couples I-ART
still O
dance O
late O

it O

not O

Almeri B-ART

barely O

A O

through O
the O

the O

not O

the O

the O

out B-ART
the O

The O
light O
from O
the O

casts O
long O

across O
the O

Shadowy B-ART

the O

A O

out B-ART
of O
some O
unused O
space O
in O
the O
universe O
good O
thing O
there's O
space O
to O
spare O
. O
The O
walls O
if O
you O
can O
call O
them O
that O
are O
a O
featureless O
expanse O
of O
gray O
that O
seems O
to O
vanish O
into O
the O
distance O
. O
The O
previous O

not O
have O
had O
enough O
time O
to O

warping O
the O
space O
into O
a O
more O

. O
A O
swirling B-ART
portal I-ART
is O
the O
only O
way O
out B-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
center O
of O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
roman O
camp O
, O
though O
long O
since O
converted O
to O
the O
uses O
of O
their O
successors O
. O
It O
is O
apparently O
abandoned O
though O
the O
vegetation O
is O
only O
just O
starting O
to O
encroach O
upon O
the O
trampled O
ground O
. O
In O
all O
directions O
you O
can O
see O
various O
structures O
and O
beyond O
them O
a O
crude B-ART
palisade I-ART
. O
A O
wooden B-ART
tower I-ART
stands O
to O
one O
side O
. O
The O
swirling B-ART
portal I-ART
leads O
back O
to O
the O
vortex O
. O


To O
the O
southwest O
stands O
a O
squat O
wooden B-ART
structure O
. O
Large O
windows O
are O
line O
the O
north O
side O
and O
the O
east O
is O
half O
open O
to O
the O
world O
with O
only O
a O
small B-ART
wooden I-ART
gate I-ART
provides O
a O
sense O
of O
enclosure O
. O
The O
earth O
to O
the O
east O
is O
packed O
into O
a O
dirt O
road O
and O
to O
the O
north O
and O
northeast O
you O
can O
spot O
other O
buildings O
in O
the O
camp O
. O


Ruts O
in O
the O
dry O
ground O
continue O
to O
the O
south O
to O
a O
gap O
in O
the O
palisade B-ART
where O
a O
gate B-ART
stands O
. O
The O
wall O
continues O
to O
either O
side O
vanishing O
between O
the O
camp B-ART
structures O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
camp B-ART
is O
arrayed O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
stand O
at O
the O
eastern O
edge O
of O
the O
camp O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
a O
large O
wooden O
structure O
with O
a O
massive B-ART
door I-ART
. O
You O
can O
make O
out B-ART
a O
few O
of O
the O
other O
structures O
of O
the O
camp O
off O
to O
the O
east O
. O
Along O
one O
wall O
there O
is O
a O
procession O
of O
small O
circles O
of O
shorter O
grass O
ending O
at O
a O
few O
rotting O
barrels B-ART
. O


The O
world O
is O
indeed O
made O
of O
shades O
of O
grey O
. O
To O
the O
southeast O
is O
a O
perfect O
example O
of O
the O
fuzziness O
between O
hutness O
and O
non O
hutness O
. O
While O
it O
does O
boast O
four B-ART
walls O
, O
such O
large O
windows O
have O
been O
cut O
to O
leave O
little O
more O
than O
the O
support O
beams O
remaining O
. O
Similarly O
the O
roof O
is O
built O
around O
a O
large O
chimney O
leaving O
very O
little O
roof O
left O
to O
consider O
. O
The O
camp O
continues O
to O
the O
north O
and O
west O
. O


Extending O
from O
where O
you O
stand O
north O
and O
east O
up O
to O
the O
pallisade O
, O
is O
a O
bare O
patch B-ART
of I-ART
ground I-ART
. O
Several O
rectangular B-ART
areas B-ART
are O
hinted O
at O
be O
the O
patterns O
of O
the O
returning O
grass B-ART
and O
marred O
earth O
. O
Structures O
rise O
to O
the O
south O
and O
west O
. O


To O
the O
west O
stands O
an O
unimposing O
structure O
, O
low O
to O
the O
ground O
with O
canvas O
walls O
. O
Around O
the O
edges O
however O
, O
the O
canvas O
has O
begun O
to O
peal O
aside O
and O
you O
can O
see O
a O
much O
more O
intricate O
structure O
. O
The O
canvas O
hides O
a O
wooden O
structure O
with O
the O
seams O
carefully O
sealed O
. O
Facing O
you O
is O
a O
wide B-ART
door I-ART
, O
almost O
large O
enough O
to O
admit O
a O
half O
dozen O
people O
at O
a O
time O
. O
The O
camp O
opens O
up O
around O
with O
the O
nearest O
structures O
a O
decent O
walk O
away O
. O


Extending O
from O
where O
you O
stand O
north O
and O
west O
up O
to O
the O
pallisade O
, O
is O
a O
bare O
patch B-ART
of I-ART
ground I-ART
. O


A O
large O
tent B-ART
stands O
to O
the O
north O
. O
The O
heavy O
cloth O
is O
weathered O
and O
torn O
in O
places O
but O
still O
remains O
largely O
intact O
. O
A O
pair O
of O
standards O
flank O
the O
entrance B-ART
as O
attentive O
guards O
. O
Two B-ART
strips O
of O
canvas B-ART
provide O
an O
appearance O
of O
privacy O
for O
the O
occupant O
. O
The O
camp O
stretches O
out B-ART
everywhere O
else O
, O
a O
tower O
rises O
from O
a O
large O
open O
area O
to O
the O
south O
, O
with O
buildings O
on O
either O
side O
. O


The O
tent B-ART
has O
an O
illusion O
of O
spaciousness O
, O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
furnishings O
. O
There O
is O
certainly O
space O
for O
them O
and O
imprints O
on O
the O
ground O
remain O
, O
but O
only O
a O
wooden B-ART
table I-ART
stands O
here O
. O


Around O
you O
is O
a O
small O
forge B-ART
not O
unlike O
the O
hasty O
reconstructions O
found O
at O
the O
local O
fair O
. O
The O
bare O
necessities O
to O
demonstrate O
metalwork O
the O
anvil B-ART
, O
the O
forge B-ART
and O
the O
large O
doorway O
via O
which O
you O
escape O
the O
heat O
. O


There O
is O
a O
tree B-ART
here O
, O
decorated O
with O
ornaments B-ART
and O
surrounded O
by O
piles B-ART
of I-ART
presents I-ART
. O
There O
is O
also O
a O
table B-ART
off O
to O
one O
side O
. O
The O
closet B-ART
is O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


This O
is O
the O
closet B-ART
where O
you O
will O
be O
spending O
the O
night O
. O
It O
is O
full O
of O
things O
that O
you O
don't O
need O
to O
think O
about O
right O
now O
. O


The O
foggy B-ART
light I-ART
coming O
from O
the O
grates B-ART
on O
the O
top B-ART
half O
of O
the O
stairwell B-ART
looks O
like O
a O
cascade O
of O
dusty B-ART
milk I-ART
. O
You O
are O
standing O
just O
mere O
feet O
from O
your O
house O
entrance B-ART
, O
above O
the O
first O
step B-ART
outside I-ART
. O


The O
faint B-ART
lights I-ART
get O
fainter B-ART
here O
. O
A O
sturdy O
door B-ART
opens O
on O
the O
Avenues O
, O
to O
the O
north O
. O
A O
flight B-ART
of I-ART
stairs I-ART
moves O
up O
to O
your O
front O
door B-ART
. O


The O
vivid O
pink B-ART
of O
the O
Monarch B-ART
sky I-ART
paints O
an O
eternal O
sunset B-ART
and O
washes O
the O
street O
and O
the O
buildings O
in O
a O
somewhat O
romantic O
nuance O
. O
The O
door B-ART
to O
your O
condominium O
lies O
south O
of O
here O
, O
reflecting O
the O
three B-ART
suns I-ART
like O
a O
gigantic O
kaleidoscope O
. O
The O
Avenue B-ART
runs O
out B-ART
of O
sight O
in O
every O
direction O
, O
finding O
outlets B-ART
in O
a O
handful O
of O
other O
busy O
streets B-ART
. O
The O
one O
you O
need O
runs O
east O
, O
towards O
the O
train O
station O
. O


Here O
the O
street B-ART
forks O
in O
two O
different O
branches O
, O
one O
disappearing O
southeast O
into O
the O
train O
station O
, O
the O
other O
going O
on O
to O
the O
east O
. O
To O
the O
west O
lies O
your O
house O
. O


The O
cyanotic O
, O
vibrating O
light O
of O
the O
station O
stands O
as O
a O
formal O
counterweight O
to O
the O
usual O
pink O
of O
the O
open O
air O
. O
People B-ART
from O
all O
the O
country O
crowd O
the O
hall O
, O
piling O
up O
like O
chickens O
in O
stocks O
. O
The O
loud O
whistle O
of O
the O
incoming O
and O
departing O
trains B-ART
dopplers O
through O
the O
place O
and O
drills O
into O
your O
ears O
. O
The O
rails B-ART
cut O
the O
earth O
in O
two O
further O
south O
, O
while O
a O
more O
breathable O
atmosphere O
breaks O
in O
through O
the O
entrance O
, O
northwest O
and O
up O
from O
here O
. O


You O
are O
floating O
, O
inert O
, O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
a O
huge O
chamber O
. O
In O
front O
of O
you O
, O
just O
out B-ART
of O

, O
is O
the O
vast O
observation O
window B-ART
; O
above O
you O
is O
the O
floor O

St O
. O
Catherine's O
has O
an O
excellent O
gymnasium O
for O
its O
female B-ART
students O
, O
but O
of O
course O
it's O
of O
little O
use O
to O
you O
. O
The O
only O
reason O
you're O
here O
is O
because O
your O
friend B-ART
Amy I-ART
practically O
begged O
you O
to O
come O
with O
her O
. O


The O
hallway O
outside O
the O
gym O
is O
nothing O
special O
. O
Some B-ART
trophies I-ART
. O
The O
Christian B-ART
cross I-ART
. O
An O
aquarium B-ART
of I-ART
fish I-ART
. O
The O
hallway O
continues O
south O
, O
the O
gym O
is O
west O
, O
the O
chapel O
east O
, O
and O
the O
exit O
to O
the O
street O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


The O
south O
end O
of O
the O
hallway O
is O
even O
less O
interesting O
than O
the O
north O
end O
, O
except O
for O
a O
sewer B-ART
grating I-ART
in O
the O
floor O
. O


You O
are O
sitting O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
wide O
open O
field O
on O
a O
beautiful O
spring O
afternoon O
. O
The O
sky B-ART
is O
clear O
with O
only O
a O
few O
clouds B-ART
hovering O
overhead O
and O
the O
sun B-ART
is O
hovering O
bright O
, O
making O
the O
details O
of O
the O
landscape O
crisp O
and O
clear O
. O
There O
is O
no O
breeze O
but O
you O
still O
feel O
pleasantly O
cool O
. O
A O
few O
flies B-ART
buzz O
menacingly O
around O
your O
picnic B-ART
basket I-ART
which O
lies O
open O
at O
your O
side O
. O
To O
the O
north O
is O
a O

To O
the O
west O
is O
a O
lake B-ART

To O
the O
south O

are O
open O
fields O
as O
far O
as O
the O

Traven B-ART
had O
come O
ashore O
at O
midnight O
, O
after O
a O
hazardous O
search O
for O
an O
opening O
in O
the O
reef O
. O
The O
small O
motorboat O
he O
had O
hired O
from O
an O
Australian O
pearl O
diver O
at O
Charlotte O
Island O
subsided O
into O
the O
shallows O
, O
its O
hull O
torn O
by O
the O
sharp O
coral O
. O
Exhausted O
, O
Traven B-ART
walked O
through O
the O
darkness O
among O
the O
dunes O
, O
where O
the O
dim O
outlines B-ART
of O
bunkers O
and O
concrete O
towers O
loomed O
between O
the O
palms O
. O
The O
shore O
seemed O
to O
extend O
forever O
to O
the O
North O
and O
South O
, O
offering O
no O
escape O
from O
the O
booming O
waves O
. O
He O
knew O
he O
needed O
to O
finally O
escape O
from O
the O
sea O
. O


The O
sound O
of O
the O
waves O
became O
unbearable O
to O
Traven B-ART

your O

for O
the O
shape B-ART
of O
a O
small O
island B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
half O
hidden O
in O
the O
mist B-ART
. O


I O
spy O
with O
my O
little O
eye O
. O
. O
. O
A O
bar B-ART
stool I-ART

You're O
inside O
a O
small O
and O
cosy O
pub O
. O
A O
sign O
painted O
over O
the O
bar B-ART
reads O
'The O
Nobody O
Inn' O
. O
Certainly O
, O
the O
place O
seems O
to O
be O
deserted O
and O
you O
can O
see O
no O
exits O
. O
The O
room O
is O
lit O
by O
a O
large O
window B-ART
that O
is O
next O
to O
a O
closed O
door B-ART
. O


The O
balloonport B-ART
is O
in O
the O
tiny O
settlement O
of O
New O
Uppsala O
. O
Through O
the O
downpour O
, O
you O
can O
make O
out B-ART
a O
cluster O
of O
buildings B-ART
a O
short B-ART
distance O
away O
. O
Houses B-ART
, O
at O
a O
guess O
, O
but B-ART
in O
a O
bewildering O
assortment O
of O
architectural B-ART
styles O
. O
In O
front O
of O
you O
a O
small B-ART
customs I-ART
desk I-ART
separates O
an O
official B-ART
from O
your O
fellow B-ART
passengers I-ART
as O
they O
see O
to O
their B-ART
luggage I-ART
and I-ART
papers I-ART
. O


In O
ye O
go O
! O
With O
a O
heave O
and O
shove O
, O
two O
burly O
guards O
in O
matching B-ART
green O
tights O
toss O
you O
into O
Orchestra B-ART
Pit O
. O
As O
the O
earthen O
sides O
rush O
past O
you O
and O
sunlight O
dims O
, O
you O
have O
the O
sinking O
sensation O
that O
perhaps O
Ode O
to O
a O
Duck O
was O
not O
the O
best O
choice O
from O
your O
repertoire O
. O
. O
. O


The O
earthen O
sides B-ART
of O
this O
pit B-ART
look O
loose O
and O
near O
the O
consistency O
of O
mud B-ART
. O
They O
seem O
to O
rush O
past O
as O
the O
speed O
of O
your O
descent O
increases O
. O


The O
light O
from O
above O
dims O
with O
each B-ART
passing O
moment O
. O
A O
large O
gnarled B-ART
root I-ART
from O
some O
hidden O
root B-ART
system O
protrudes O
from O
the O
side B-ART
of O
the O
pit B-ART
here O
. O


Although O
the O
bottom B-ART
is O
quite O
dark O
, O
you O
think O
you O
are O
about O
halfway O
down O
the O
pit B-ART
. O
The O
end B-ART
of O
a O
rope B-ART
is O
caught O
in O
the O
muddy B-ART
wall B-ART
here O
and O
the O
length B-ART
of O
the O
rope B-ART
hangs O
down O
about O
five O
feet O
. O


You O
can O
just O
barely O
make O
out O
the O
bottom B-ART
of O
the O
pit B-ART
, O
far O
below O
you O
. O
A O
small O
outcropping B-ART
of I-ART
stone I-ART
juts O
from O
the O
side B-ART
of O
the O
pit B-ART
here O
. O


You O
are O
almost O
at O
the O
bottom B-ART
of O
the O
pit B-ART
. O
Now O
that O
impact O
is O
so O
imminent O
, O
you O
almost O
wish O
you O
could O
keep O
on O
falling O
. O


The O
pit B-ART
is O
about O
twenty O
yards O
in O
diameter O
and O
run B-ART
off I-ART
from O
the O
sides B-ART
drains O
into O
a O
large O
mud B-ART
puddle I-ART
in O
the O
center O
of O
floor O
. O
Every O
step O
squelches O
like O
grapes O
under O
a O
cart O
wheel O
and O
the O
air O
is O
thick O
with O
the O
odour O
of O
mud B-ART
and O
mildew O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
King's O
Street O
, O
outside B-ART
the O
public O
entrance O
of O
The O
National O
Board O
of O
Sustainable O
Development O
. O
The O
Board O
is O
located O
in O
a O
wealthy O
neighbourhood O
in O
the O
city O
centre O
. O
The O
street O
is O
lined O
with O
blocks O
of O
flats O
from O
the O
early O
twentieth O
century O
, O
mixed O
with O
governmental O
buildings O
and O
shops O
. O


You O
live O
in O
a O
simple O
one O
room B-ART
flat O
in O
Suburbia O
. O


The O
entrance O
hall B-ART
is O
a O
small O
room O
without O
windows O
just O
inside O
the O
door B-ART
. O
There's O
a O
reception O
desk O
there O
and O
a O
glass O
door B-ART
leading O
to O
the O
north O
. O
To O
the O
east O
you O
can O
see O
a O
huge O
notice B-ART
board I-ART
and O
a O
wastepaper B-ART
basket B-ART
. O
Next O
to O
the O
north O
door B-ART
is O
a O
button B-ART
. O


The O
supermarket O
has O
an O
advantageous O
position O
next O
to O
the O
Board O
. O
The O
civil O
servants O
buy O
their O
fast B-ART
food I-ART
, O
soft O
drinks O
and O
other O
eatables O
here O
. O


Loose O
, O
muddy O
soil B-ART
covers O
most O
of O
the O
ground B-ART
and O
the O
air O
is O
heavy O
with O
the O
deep O
, O
fertile O
smell O
of O
freshly O
turned O
earth B-ART
. O
Nearby O
, O
a O
large O
hole B-ART
gapes O
darkly O
, O
the O
depths O
of O
which O
are O
hidden O
in O
shadow O
. O


An O
iron O
wrought O
gate B-ART
lies O
askew O
on O
rusted B-ART
hinges B-ART
, O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
prevent O
external O
access O
to O
the O
churchyard B-ART
during O
late O
hours O
. O
The O
muddy B-ART
path I-ART
leading O
past O
them O
and O
southwards O
into O
the O
church O
grounds B-ART
is O
being O
churned O
by O
the O
heavy O
rain B-ART
, O
but O
not O
quite O
enough O
to O
completely O
obscure O
a O
faint B-ART
impression I-ART
therein O
. O


There O
is O
just O
enough O
room O
in O
this O
tiny O
hut O
to O
sit O
and O
keep O
watch O
were O
there O
still O
a O
chair O
upon O
which O
to O
sit O
. O
Presently O
, O
nothing O
remains O
but O
a O
cramped O
space O
to O
stand O
while O
one O
gains O
a O
moment's O
respite O
from O
the O
ceaseless O
downpour O
outside B-ART
. O


The O
gravel B-ART
path I-ART
you O
are O
on O
passes O
by O
a O
plot O
of O
manicured B-ART
land I-ART
upon O
which O
resides O
a O
small O
church B-ART
building I-ART
. O
It O
is O
fashioned O
of O
dark B-ART
river I-ART
stone I-ART
, I-ART
stained I-ART
all O
the O
darker B-ART
from B-ART
the O
downpour O
. O
Its O
steeple B-ART
rises O
suddenly O
into O
the O
gloom O
, O
so O
that O
the O
belfry B-ART
up O
top O
is O
partially O
obscured O
. O
Through O
the O
barred O
windows B-ART
a O
glimmer O
of O
yellow O
light O
issues O
, O
flickering O
like O
candlelight B-ART
. O
The O
front O
entrance O
is O
to O
the O
east O
, O
while O
the O
path B-ART
continues O
south O
. O


Here O
is O
where O
parishioners O
must O
have O
parked O
their O
vehicles O
, O
be O
they O
wagon O
or O
automobile O
, O
before O
proceeding O
north O
to O
the O
church B-ART
building I-ART
. O
A O
gravel B-ART
road I-ART
leads O
north O
past O
the O
front O
of O
the O
church B-ART
. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
a O
rain B-ART
slicked O
road B-ART
leads O
off O
into O
the O
dark B-ART
distance O
. O
East O
of O
here O
is O
a O
wooden O
coach B-ART
house I-ART
. O


The O
coach O
house O
is O
quite O
old O
, O
and O
indeed O
once O
served O
to O
house O
a O
horse O
driven O
coach O
. O
It O
has O
since O
been O
converted O
for O
use O
by O
automobiles O
. O
There O
are O
shelves B-ART
lining O
the O
walls B-ART
containing O
various O
items B-ART
one O
would O
expect O
to O
find O
in O
a O
garage O
. O
Against O
the O
north O
wall O
is O
a O
rubber B-ART
tire I-ART
. O
Access O
to O
the O
driveway O
is O
to O
the O
west O
, O
through O
the O
main O
entrance O
, O
and O
a O
small O
exit O
leads O
east O
. O


Running O
between O
the O
coach O
house O
and O
a O
small B-ART
shack I-ART
to O
the O
east O
, O
this O
path B-ART
is O
lined O
on O
both B-ART
sides O
by O
tall O
brush B-ART
and I-ART
bracken I-ART
, O
which O
block O
your O
view O
elsewhere O
. O


A O
small B-ART
shack I-ART
rises O
out B-ART
of O
the O
overgrowth B-ART
in O
a O
clearing B-ART
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
winding O
path B-ART
. O
It O
looks O
quite O
old O
, O
but O
has O
not O
fallen O
into O
disrepair O
, O
as O
has O
the O
coach O
house O
and O
the O
other O
small B-ART
buildings O
on O
the O
church O
grounds B-ART
. O
Along O
the O
front O
is O
a O
wooden B-ART
door I-ART
, O
and O
a O
small B-ART
square O
window B-ART
to O
its O
right O
, O
which O
flickers O
with O
a O
pale O
yellow O
light O
issuing O
from O
within O
. O


The O
heavy B-ART
oaken I-ART
doors I-ART
of O
the O
church B-ART
loom O
before O
you O
, O
presenting O
a O
sensation O
of O
disorientation O
that O
you O
did O
not O
experience O
from B-ART
a O
distance O
. O
Great B-ART
brass I-ART
handles I-ART
present O
you O
with O
a O
means O
of O
access O
to O
shelter O
from B-ART
the O
torrential O
weather O
. O
There O
are O
curious O
inscriptions B-ART
and I-ART
bas I-ART
relief I-ART
carvings B-ART
worked O
into O
the O
wood O
. O


This O
is O
a O
very O
long B-ART
room I-ART
, O
lined O
with O
multi B-ART
tiered I-ART
bunks B-ART
. O
Flimsy B-ART
partitions I-ART
between O
the O
tiers O
may O
provide O
a O
modicum O
of O
privacy O
. O
These O
spartan B-ART
living O
quarters B-ART
could O
house O
hundreds O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
are O
sleeping O
here O
right O
now O
. O
There O
are O
archways B-ART
on O
the O
north O
and O
east O
walls O
. O


The O
bright O
sunlight B-ART
hurts O
your O
eyes O
, O
causing O
you O
to O
squint O
for O
a O
moment O
or O
two O
before O
noticing O
your O
surroundings B-ART
. O
You're O
standing O
outside B-ART
on O
a O
large O
concrete O
terrace B-ART
, O
wedged O
in O
between O
a O
mountain B-ART
to O
the O
north O
and O
an O
immense O
black B-ART
monolith I-ART
to O
the O
south O
. O
The O
mountain B-ART
looks O
foreboding B-ART
and I-ART
scary I-ART
but O
a O
small B-ART
white I-ART
house I-ART
, O
unassumingly O
nestled O
into O
the O
base O
directly O
to O
your O
north O
, O
looks O
inviting O
enough O
. O
The O
small B-ART
, I-ART
meandering I-ART
path B-ART
which O
once O
led O
up O
the O
side O
of O
the O
mountain B-ART
to O
the O
northwest O
is O
now O
blocked O
by O
brambles B-ART
and I-ART
thickets I-ART
, O
making O
it O
impassable O
. O


On O
the O
inside O
, O
the O
phone B-ART
booth I-ART
looks O
just O
as O
normal O
as O
it O
did O
on O
the O
outside O
. O
The O
only O
difference O
is O
that O
the O
phone B-ART
, O
instead O
of O
having O
a O
slot O
for O
coins O
, O
appears O
to O
have O
a O
small B-ART
hole I-ART
for O
cork O
nuts O
. O


This O
room O
is O
brilliantly O
lit O
from O
all O
directions O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
where O
the O
walls O
and O
ceiling O
end O
. O
A O
doorway O
leads O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
tunnels O
lead O
in O
most O
other O
directions O
, O
although O
all O
but O
one O
are O
boarded B-ART
up O
. O
An O
archway O
stands O
at O
the O
south O
end O
of O
the O
hall O
. O


Rough O
hewn B-ART
tunnels I-ART
surroud O
you O
on O
all O
sides O
. O
It O
looks O
like O
more O
digging B-ART
has O
been O
done O
here O
, O
although O
the O
original O
exit O
to O
the O
northeast O
is O
still O
visible O
. O
More O
recently O
, O
though O
, O
several O
of O
the O
tunnels B-ART
appear O
to O
have O
caved O
in O
, O
and O
the O
ladder O
which O
once O
led O
up O
to O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
ceiling O
has O
disappeared O
. O


This O
tiny B-ART
, I-ART
barren I-ART
room I-ART
once O
housed O
the O
intake O
for O
the O
MUD O
incinerator B-ART
. O
Once O
garbage O
incineration B-ART
was O
outlawed O
, O
though O
when O
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
when O
you O
burn O
things O
underground O
, O
the O
air B-ART
just O
fills O
with O
soot B-ART
, O
it O
became O
just O
a O
place O
where O
people O
drop O
old O
stuff O
to O
be O
recycled O
. O


The O
once B-ART
proud I-ART
lounge B-ART
has O
been O
gutted O
right B-ART
down O
to O
the O
bare O
stone B-ART
walls I-ART
. O
All O
the O
exits O
have O
been O
bricked O
up O
, O
except O
for O
the O
one O
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
a O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
is O
all O
there O
is O
to O
show O
that O
an O
elevator B-ART
once O
lead O
upwards O
. O
An O
uncomfortable B-ART
looking B-ART
steel I-ART
chair I-ART
sits O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
room B-ART
. O


Pillows O
are O
strewn O
about O
this O
lavish B-ART
chamber I-ART
. O
Incense B-ART
and I-ART
candles I-ART
burn O
in O
the O
four O
corners B-ART
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
two O
pillars B-ART
rise O
near O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
. O
There O
is O
a O
small O
sign B-ART
mounted O
on O
the O
left O
pillar O
. O
Scratched O
into O
one O
wall B-ART
are O
the O
words B-ART
THE O
END O
IS O
NIGH O
! O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
a O
wide O
open O
square O
in O
the O
better O
part O
of O
the O
LonDome B-ART
. O
Bright O
sunlight O
shines O
through O
the O
white B-ART
, I-ART
translucent I-ART
skin B-ART
of O
the O
Dome O
high O
above O
. O
All O
around O
you O
, O
people B-ART
bustle O
about O
on O
unknown O
errands O
, O
mostly O
avoiding O
the O
seedy O
looking O
alley O
to O
the O
south O
. O
A O
small O
bookstall O
lies O
northeast O
, O
and O
stairs O
lead O
down O
to O
the O
subsurface O
shuttle O
terminal O
. O
The O
view O
, O
however O
, O
is O
dominated O
by O
the O
imposing B-ART
building I-ART
in O
the O
east O
, O
it's O
marble B-ART
facade I-ART
soaring O
up O
to O
the O
heights O
of O
the O
Dome O
. O


The O
pleasant O
nature O
of O
the O
nearby O
piazza O
is O
quickly O
forgotten O
in O
this O
gloomy O
, O
refuse B-ART
strewn O
place O
. O
Buildings O
thrust O
upward O
on O
either O
side O
, O
creating O
a O
claustrophobic O
passageway B-ART
running O
east O
. O
You O
catch O
a O
glimpse O
of O
movement B-ART
from O
within O
one O
of O
the O
many O
windows B-ART
set O
into O
the O
high B-ART
rises I-ART
. O


The O
alleyway O
ends O
suddenly O
with O
a O
rough O
wall B-ART
barring O
any O
further O
progress O
; O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
go O
except O
back O
the O
way O
you O
came O
. O


Nothing O
very O
impressive O
, O
merely O
a O
little O
kiosk O
selling O
the O
usual O
top O
10 O
bestsellers B-ART
in O
paperback B-ART
, O
newspapers B-ART
, O
a O
couple O
of O
childrens B-ART
storybooks I-ART
and I-ART
comics I-ART
, O
and O
the O
usual O
furtive B-ART
magazines I-ART
. O
Not O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
walk O
into O
and O
ask O
to O
be O
directed O
to O
the O
Reference O
section O
. O


The O
music O
is O
very O
loud O
and O
the O
place O
is O
crowded O
. O
In O
the O
middle O
is O
the O
bar B-ART

surrounded O
by O
people O
asking O
for O
drinks O
. O
Near O
the O
stairs B-ART
heading O
up O
to O
the O
exit O
are O
the O
toilets B-ART
and O
the O
lifts B-ART
. O
Standing O
close O
to O
the O
exit O
door O
is O
the O
bouncer O
. O


The O
receptionist O
is O
still O
folding O
some O
linen O
in O
the O
sofa B-ART

Some O
people O
are O
there O
watching O

To O
the O
west O
is O
the O
lift O
that O
leads O
to O
the O

. O


The O
elevator B-ART
has O
a O

typical O
classroom O
in O
the O
school O
which O
was O
built O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Great O
Depression O

Green B-ART
blackboards I-ART

replaced O
the O
old O

This O
plot O
of O
earth O
is O
where O
the O
friars B-ART
grow O
their O
herbs B-ART
. O
Back O
in O
town O
, O
it's O
whispered O
that O
they O
grow O
mandrake O
and O
nightshade O
and O
such O
vile O
things O
to O
use O
in O
sorcerous O
potions O
, O
but O
that's O
just O
talk O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
herbs B-ART
are O
good O
to O
eat O
, O
and O
others O
make O
simples O
for O
the O
sick O
, O
and O
that's O
an O
end O
to O
it O
. O
A O
trail O
south O
leads O
back O
to O
town O
, O
and O
the O
friars' B-ART
rooms O
are O
just O
inside O
the O
small O
stone O
house O
to O
north O
. O
Friar B-ART
Bungay I-ART
is O
here O
, O
patiently O
pounding O
a O
stake B-ART
into O
the O
soil O
with O
a O
sturdy B-ART
mallet I-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
on O
a O
small O
stool B-ART
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O
From O
here O
you O
can O
clearly O
see O
the O
top B-ART
of O
the O
refrigerator B-ART
, O
but O
you O
can't O
reach O
it O
. O


Except O
for O
your O
car B-ART
and O
the O
dirty O
snowdrifts B-ART
in O
the O
corners O
, O
this O
broad O
expanse O
of O
pavement B-ART
is O
entirely O
empty O
. O
The O
wind O
whistles O
a O
little O
, O
and O
instinctively O
you O
hunch O
your O
shoulders O
and O
turn O
up O
your O
collar O
. O
The O
dark B-ART
bulk I-ART
of O
the O
shopping B-ART
center I-ART
squats O
in O
decaying O
splendor O
to O
the O
south O
, O
and O
a O
paved O
walkway B-ART
leads O
in O
that O
direction O
. O


The O
heavy B-ART
structure O
of O
the O
shopping B-ART
center I-ART
stretches O
left O
and O
right O
from O
here O
. O
When O
you O
crane O
your O
neck O
the O
building B-ART
seems O
almost O
to O
be O
leaning O
outward O
, O
as O
if O
it's O
in O
some O
danger O
of O
collapsing O
on O
top O
of O
you O
, O
or O
perhaps O
pouncing O
on O
you O
. O
Doubtless O
that's O
only O
a O
trick O
of O
the O
light O
. O
An O
arched B-ART
entryway B-ART
beckons O
to O
the O
south O
, O
above O
it O
the O
inscription B-ART


In O
spite O
of O
the O
arched B-ART
ceiling I-ART
and I-ART
gilt I-ART
brickwork I-ART
, O
this O
chilly O
and O
ill O
lit O
passageway O
fails O
to O
cast O
an O
inviting O
spell O
. O
Rather O
, O
it O
gives O
an O
impression O
of O
inexpressible O
sorrow O
, O
if O
not O
outright O
squalor O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
odor O
of O
damp O
and O
decay O
is O
to O
blame O
. O
A O
door B-ART
in O
the O
east O

next O

a O
small O

seems O
more O

The O
passage O

The O

he O
snores O
faintly O
through O
his O

You O

In O

Only O
the O
soft O
breathing O
of O
your O
wife O
in O
the O
large O

breaches O
the O

The O
door O
next O
to O
the O
heavy B-ART
oaken O
wardrobe O
leads O
to O
the O
landing O
to O
the O
north O
. O
It O
is O
ice B-ART
cold O
in O
the O
unheated O
room O
. O


The O
landing B-ART
is O
enveloped O
by O
uneven O
darkness B-ART
. O
Moonlight B-ART
enters O
through O
the O
open O
door B-ART
to O
your O
bedroom B-ART
in O
the O
south O
. O
A O
red B-ART
door I-ART
to O
the O
north O
leads O
to O
the O
room B-ART
of O
your O
daughter O
Maartje B-ART
. O
Next O
to O
the O
stairs B-ART
down O
stands O
an O
elegant O
cupboard B-ART
, I-ART
above I-ART
which O
hangs O
a O
large O
ornate O
mirror B-ART
in O
a O
gilded B-ART
frame I-ART
. O


Without O
Maartje's B-ART
radiant O
presence O
, O
her O
room B-ART
seems O
dead O
and O
empty O
. O
It O
is O
a O
dreary O
sight O
a O
bed B-ART
in O
which O
nobody O
sleeps O
, O
a O
dollhouse B-ART
with O
which O
nobody O
plays O
, O
a O
desk B-ART
behind O
which O
nobody O
studies O
. O
The O
gay O
colours O
in O
which O
you O
painted O
her O
ceiling B-ART
and I-ART
furniture I-ART
appear O
in O
the O
pale O
light O
of O
the O
stars B-ART
as O
a O
pallet O
of O
greys O
. O
The O
door B-ART
to O
the O
south O
leads O
back O
to O
the O
landing B-ART
. O


To O
the O
north O
, O
the O
red B-ART
door I-ART
to O
Maartje's B-ART
room B-ART
is O
slightly O
ajar O
. O


Your O
front O
garden B-ART
too O
has O
been O
buried O
by O
a O
thick O
layer O
of O
snow O
, O
which O
hides O
all O
plants O
from B-ART
view O
. O
Only O
a O
few O
bare O
bushes B-ART
that O
crouch O
against O
the O
garden B-ART
fence I-ART
penetrate O
the O
white O
blanket B-ART
. O
Behind O
you O
, O
the O
front O
door O
leads O
back O
into O
the O
house O
, O
while O
the O
road O
to O
the O
east O
winds O
through O
the O
village O
and O
the O
forest B-ART
to O
the O
baron's B-ART
castle O
. O
From B-ART
his O
unreachable O
heights O
the O
moon O
looks O
reproachfully O
down O
on O
you O
. O
The O
tip O
of O
the O
church O
tower O
can O
be O
seen O
above O
the O
houses B-ART
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O


But O
you O
firmly O
step O
onwards O
while O
you O
try O
to O
devise O
a O
plan O
for O
entering O
the O
baron's O
castle O
. O
Then O
, O
suddenly O
, O
the O
howling O
of O
wolves O
starts O
you O
out O
of O
your O
reflections O
. O
It O
is O
hard O
to O
judge O
, O
but O
you O
would O
be O
surprised O
if O
they O
are O
more O
than O
a O
kilometer O
away O
from B-ART
you O
. O
And O
it O
is O
at O
least O
another O
ten O
kilometers O
eastward O
to O
the O
baron's O
castle O
. O


Even O
on O
the O
sunniest O
days O
, O
this O
coniferous B-ART
forest B-ART
is O
dim O
and O
gloomy O
, O
and O
in O
the O
dead O
of O
this O
winter B-ART
night O
it O
is O
pitch O
dark O
. O
A O
path B-ART
, O
hardly O
recognisable O
as O
such O
, O
leads O
from O
the O
village O
in O
the O
west O
to O
the O
castle O
in O
the O
east O
. O
The O
howls B-ART
of O
a O
pack B-ART
of I-ART
wolves I-ART
rise O
from O
nearby O
. O
In O
this O
season O
game O
is O
scarce O
, O
and O
the O
wolves B-ART
are O
hungry O
, O
bold O
and O
dangerous O
even O
to O
men O
. O


Here O
the O
path B-ART
is O
narrow O
and O
winding O
, O
and O
hardly O
recognisable O
under O
the O
snow B-ART
. O
Moonlight B-ART
penetrates O
the O
dense O
foliage O
only O
sporadically O
. O
Eastwards O
lies O
the O
baron's O
castle O
; O
to O
the O
west O
, O
your O
own O
footprints O
lead O
back O
to O
the O
village O
. O


Eastwards O
lies O
the O
stone O
house O
of O
the O
hunter O
; O
to O
the O
west O
, O
the O
tracks O
of O
your O
prey O
lead O
to O
were O
the O
humans B-ART
live O
. O


From O
this O
part O
of O
the O
winding O
path B-ART
, O
you O
can O
see O
the O
stone B-ART
house I-ART
of O
the O
evil O
human O
rising O
in O
the O
east O
. O
The O
silhouette O
with O
the O
three O
leaning O
towers B-ART
is O
outlined O
against O
the O
starry B-ART
sky B-ART
. O
A O
trail B-ART
of I-ART
paw I-ART
prints I-ART
yours O
indicates O
the O
path B-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O
It O
is O
silent O
here O
; O
even O
the O
howling O
of O
your O
pack O
has O
faded O
. O


The O
trees B-ART
whisper O
softly O
in O
the O
cool O
autumn O
breeze O
. O
You O
stand B-ART
on O
the O
northern O
fringe O
of O
the O
forest B-ART
, O
beside O
the O
muddy B-ART
track B-ART
which O
shows O
the O
fresh B-ART
tracks I-ART
of O
the O
car O
that O
brought O
you O
, O
now O
vanished O
into O
the O
haze O
. O


The O
old B-ART
wet I-ART
trees I-ART
loom O
above O
the O
trail B-ART
leading O
to O
the O
south O
. O
Bracken B-ART
and I-ART
ferns I-ART
poke O
their O
heads O
up O
from O
beneath O
the O
carpet B-ART
of I-ART
leaves I-ART
. O


The O
stark B-ART
dead I-ART
trees I-ART
tower O
around O
you O
in O
a O
motionless O
eldritch O
dance O
. O


This O
is O
the O
upstairs O
lobby B-ART
of O
the O
RSP O
corporation O
. O
It's O
very O
different O
from O
the O
downstairs O
lobby B-ART
, O
in O
that O
it O
doesn't O
have O
a O
nice B-ART
reception I-ART

or O
a O
shiny B-ART

It O
does O
have O
a O

, O
though O
. O
There's O
a O
storage O
closet O
north O
of O
you O
and O
a O
shower O

the O

A O
really O
long O
hallway O
leads O
east O
, O
to O
freedom O

This O
room O
is O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
the O
employees O
who O
work O
with O
sprockets O
and O
tend O
to O
end O
up O

. O
It O
has O
many O
shower B-ART
heads I-ART
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
showering B-ART
. O


It O
is O
a O
closet B-ART
which O
is O
used O
to O
store O
things O
. O
It O
is O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
small O
storage B-ART

, O
and O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
break O
room O
, O
it O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O
A O
creative O
mind O
could O
possible O
even O
construe O
that O
vending O
machine O
as O
a O
trophy O
case O
. O
But O
it O
wasn't O
really O
intentional O
. O


The O
hallway B-ART
stretches O
on O
for O
a O
nigh O
unimaginable O
distance O
to O
the O
east O
. O
Somewhere O
out O
there O
is O
the O
elevator O
which O
will O
take O
you O
downstairs O
so O
you O
can O
go O
find O
the O

Your O

is O
a O
nicely O

The O
old O
, O
once O
upon O
a O
time O
sturdy O
wooden O

had O
crossed O
the O
Clearwater B-ART
River O
from O

for O
as O
long O
as O
the O
prince O
could O

it O
had O

there O
long O
before O

when O
the O

young O

He O
fondly O
remembered O
hiding O
in O
the O
thick O
scrub O
below O
the O
bridge B-ART
from O
his O
father's O
guards O
when O
he O
was O
but O
a O

A O

You O

only O

Due O
to O
its O
versatility O
of O
design O
, O
this O

can O
allow O

in O
either O
of O
two O

Mr O

Oddly O

This O

Mmhmm O

The O

OK O

of O
the O
day O
, O
with O
no O
seats B-ART
available O
. O
You O
sometimes O
occupy O
yourself B-ART
by O
reading O
the O
ads B-ART
above O
the O
windows B-ART
, O
but O
most O
of O
the O
time O
you O
just O
stare O
out B-ART
the O
windows B-ART
as O
you O
wait O
patiently O
for O
your O
stop O
when O
you O
can O
push O
your O
way O
through O
the O
nearest O
exit B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
main O
work B-ART
area O
of O
Bob's B-ART
Garage I-ART
. O
Two B-ART
of O
the O
walls B-ART
are O
lined O
with O
shelves B-ART
containing O
car B-ART
parts I-ART
, O
and O
one O
wall B-ART
is O
lined O
with O
cabinets B-ART
full O
of O
tools B-ART
. O
Over O
the O
tools B-ART
is O
a O
clock B-ART
telling O
you O
just O
how O
late O
it O
currently O
is O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
the O
lift B-ART
you O
usually O
use O
to O
raise O
cars B-ART
when O
working B-ART
under O
them O
is O
broken O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
has O
the O
garage B-ART
door I-ART
through O
which O
cars B-ART
enter O
and O
leave O
. O
At O
the O
southern O
end O
of O
the O
room O
is O
Bob's B-ART
office I-ART
, O
but O
he O
doesn't O
like O
you O
going O
in O
there O
when O
he's O
not O
around O
. O


Bob O
has O
a O
small O
and O
cramped O
office O
mainly O
a O
private O
place O
for O
him B-ART
to O
work O
on O
the O
desk B-ART
wedged O
into O
the O
corner O
next O
to O
the O
filing B-ART
cabinet I-ART
. O
The O
only O
pleasant O
thing O
about O
the O
office O
is O
the O
coolness O
provided O
by O
the O
air B-ART
conditioner I-ART
on O
warm O
summer O
days O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
the O
cramped O
stuffiness O
makes O
you O
long O
to O
go O
back O
out B-ART
to O
the O
garage B-ART
you O
see O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
back O
lot O
behind O
the O
backyard O
of O
the O
house O
your O
house O
to O
the O
east O
. O
There's O
lots O
of O
junk O
here O
that O
your O
father B-ART
has O
accumulated O
over O
the O
years O
, O
which O
reminds O
of O
what O
the O
inside O
of O
your O
locker O
looks O
like O
at O
school O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
your O
backyard O
. O
Mother's B-ART
well O
tended O
garden O
sits O
in O
the O
corner O
that O
you O
dutifully O
avoid O
trampling O
through O
, O
at O
least O
when O
she's O
looking O
. O
Oh O
, O
the O
hours O
you O
spend O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
dreaming O
up O
schemes O
to O
destroy O
her O
flowers O
while O
leaving O
you O
with O
a O
perfect O
alibi O
. O
You O
can O
enter O
the O
house B-ART
to O
the O
east O
or O
go O
around O
it O
to O
the O
northeast O
or O
southeast O
. O


This O
is O
the O
front O
porch O
of O
your O
house B-ART
. O
Maybe O
someday O
you'll O
be O
able O
to O
finally O
say O
more O
than O
three O
words O
to O
Melanie O
and O
she'll O
come O
by O
and O
visit O
and O
you O
can O
sit O
on O
the O
rocker O
out O
here O
and O
do O
whatever O
exactly O
it O
is O
that O
kids O
do O
in O
that O
sort O
of O
situation O
. O
You O
can O
enter O
the O
house B-ART
to O
the O
west O
, O
or O
go O
out O
to O
the O
street O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
staring O
at O
the O
dingy O
ceiling O
of O
a O
recovery B-ART
room O
in O
a O
clinic O
. O
The O
image O
swims O
a O
little O
above O
you O
, O
sometimes O
detailed O
and O
sharp O
, O
sometimes O
fuzzy O
, O
as O
your O
head O
clears O
. O
The O
fluorescent B-ART
light B-ART
on O
the O
ceiling O
above O
you O
is O
slightly O
dimmed B-ART
, O
giving O
the O
whole O
room O
an O
almost O
orange O
cast O
. O
You O
can't O
see O
much O
more O
without O
getting O
up O
from O
the O
cold O
cot B-ART
underneath O
you O
. O
But O
you O
can O
smell O
unpleasant O
, O
antiseptic O
chemicals O
. O


Your O
office O
, O
where O
you O
carry O
out O
your O
Bastardly O
duties O
, O
is O
equipped O
with O
the O
finest O
furnishings O
and O
equipment O
necessary O
to O
perform O
your O
work O
. O
As O
you O
have O
an O
aversion O
to O
cheap O
kit O
, O
your O
desk B-ART
is O
the O
finest O
example O
of O
office O
furniture B-ART
ever O
bestowed O
upon O
the O
human O
race O
. O
Sitting O
atop O
this O
monument O
to O
furniture B-ART
is O
the O
single O
most O
powerful B-ART
computer I-ART
in O
the O
company O
; O
your O
personal O
workstation B-ART
. O
Only O
two O
decorations O
adorn O
the O
walls B-ART
; O
a O
Bill B-ART
Gatus I-ART
of I-ART
Borg I-ART
poster I-ART
and O
a O
daily O
calendar B-ART
. O
North O
leads O
out O
of O
Mission O
Control O
to O
other O
, O
less O
important O
areas O
while O
you O
spot O
a O
very O
large O
and O
serious O
looking O
door O
down O
the O
hall O
just O
east O
. O


Stephen O
is O
standing O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
cubicles B-ART
looking O
confused O
and O
stressed O
. O
In O
other O
words O
, O
normal O
. O


This O
medium O
sized O
room O
looks O
very O
much O
like O
the O
IT O
department O
except O
there O
are O
just O
four O
cubicles B-ART
which O
are O
home O
to O
the O
technical O
support O
staff O
. O
The O
combination O
of O
no O
ventilation O
, O
strong O
body O
odor O
, O
poor O
shelving O
and O
gross O
incompetence O
leaves O
a O
heady O
, O
almost O
metallic O
taste O
on O
your O
tongue O
. O
This O
area O
opens O
up O
to O
a O
larger O
room O
just O
west O
while O
a O
storage O
room O
is O
south O
. O


This O
non O
descript O
store O
room O
is O
used O
mostly O
as O
an O
adhoc O
changing O
room O
for O
employees O
that O
want O
to O
don O
civilian O
clothes B-ART
when O
not O
in O
the O
office O
. O
A O
number O
of O
suits B-ART
all O
in O
as O
new O
condition O
line O
the O
walls B-ART
. O


This O
large O
covered O
area O
allowed O
sunlight O
to O
splash O
in O
from O
six O
floors O
above O
you O
. O
All O
around O
you O
is O
plantlife B-ART
surrounding O
a O
beautiful O
fountain B-ART
. O
The O
chief O
function O
of O
all O
this O
scenery O
is O
to O
distract O
you O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
work O
in O
a O
concrete O
shell O
surrounded O
by O
people O
with O
disgusting O
personal O
problems O
who O
resent O
you O
. O
Large O
marble B-ART
steps I-ART
lead O
down O
to O
the O
lobby O
. O


The O
prevailing O
philosophy O
of O
your O
boss B-ART
Play O
it O
safe O
. O
extended O
to O
the O
heavy O
management O
decision O
of O
how O
to O
decorate O
his O
office O
; O
there O
is O
absolutely O
no O
distinction O
or O
personality O
here O
. O
A O
bookcase B-ART
occupies O
one O
wall B-ART
stocked O
with O
nothing O
but O
a O
couple O
of O
corporate O
manuals B-ART
and O
an O
endless O
number O
of O
For O
Dummies B-ART
books B-ART
. O
Another O
wall B-ART
is O
home O
to O
an O
alcohol O
stained O
filing B-ART
cabinet I-ART
. O
A O
simple O
cherrywood B-ART
desk B-ART
is O
here O
with O
the O
boss's B-ART
laptop B-ART
sitting O
on O
top O
. O


A O
tiny O
, O
cramped O
living O
space O
. O
Your O
bed O
takes O
up O
about O
half O
of O
it O
, O
your O
wheelchair B-ART
half O
of O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
a O
small O
bed B-ART
side I-ART
table I-ART
half O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
that O
. O
There O
is O
a O
mirror B-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
and O
the O
door B-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
pretty O
town O
square O
in O
the O
center O
of O
a O
nondescript O
New O
England O
town O
. O
Like O
most O
any O
other O
nondescript O
New O
England O
towns O
, O
there's O
not O
much O
to O
see O
or O
do O
here O
, O
but B-ART
maybe O
you'll O
find O
something O
amusing B-ART
and O
enjoyable O
to O
do O
. O


This O
room O
is O
full O
of O
skulls O
and O
bones O
. O
Right O
before O
you O
lies O
the O
slain O
corpse B-ART
of O
the O
famous O
adventurer O
Monathan O
Mlask O
, O
who O
has O
met O
his O
doom O
here O
. O
A O
door B-ART
leads O
, O
hm O
, O
let's O
say O
southeast O
. O


Ted's O
old O
office B-ART
is O
a O
windowless O
cell O
, O
with O
cinderblock O
walls O
that O
remind O
you O
of O
your O
first O
dorm O
room O
. O
Fluorescent O
lights O
glare O
down O
on O
you O
from O
the O
ceiling O
, O
warehouse O
style O
, O
bothering B-ART
your O
eyes O
. O
The O
room O
is O
in O
chaos O
you O
hardly O
know O
what O
to O
look O
at O
first O
. O
His O
desk B-ART
and I-ART
chair I-ART
are O
pushed O
up O
against O
a O
corner O
, O
and O
the O
walls O
are O
lined O
with O
shelves B-ART
, O
posters O
, O
art O
and O
trinkets O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
sparse O
, O
small O
room O
with O
no O
decoration O
whatsoever O
. O
It O
stinks O
of O
garbage B-ART
, O
metal O
and O
oil O
. O
From O
here O
, O
you O
can O
go O
north O
into O
the O
main O
museum O
hall O
, O
west O
into O
a O
nasty O
little O
break O
room O
, O
and O
east O
down O
a O
smelly O
hallway O
. O


This O
is O
a O
break O
room O
, O
you O
guess O
? O
It O
lacks O
a O
kitchenette O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
with O
no O
counters O
, O
no O
sinks O
and O
no O
cupboards O
. O
The O
large O
refrigerator B-ART
in O
the O
corner O
looks O
lonely O
, O
its O
surface O
bare O
of O
adornment O
. O
With O
a O
complete O
lack O
of O
tables O
or O
chairs O
, O
it O
seems O
less O
and O
less O
credible O
that O
any O
people O
work O
here O
. O


Of O
all O
of O
the O
halls O
, O
this O
is O
the O
grandest O
. O
It O
even O
has O
a O
sweeping B-ART
staircase I-ART
going O
up O
to O
a O
balcony O
type O
thing O
that O
overlooks O
where O
you're O
standing O
. O
This O
room O
was O
created O
exclusively O
to O
house O
the O
magnificent B-ART
braintree B-ART
, O
which O
is O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
. O
The O
maintenance O
room O
where O
you O
woke O
up O
is O
to O
the O
south O
, O
and O
an O
unobtrusive B-ART
door B-ART
with O
an O
excessively O
obtrusive O
padlock B-ART
on O
it O
is O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
balcony O
looks O
out B-ART
over O
the O
magnificent B-ART
braintree's B-ART
gently O
furred B-ART
canopy I-ART
. O
There's O
an O
exhibit B-ART
shelf I-ART
here O
labeled O
The O
Hundred O
Year O
Old O
Typewriter B-ART
. O
A O
sweeping B-ART
staircase I-ART
leads O
back O
down O
to O
the O
Great O
Hall O
. O


There O
is O
nothing O
special O
about O
this O
corridor O
, O
except O
for O
the O
fire B-ART
door I-ART
and O
the O
control B-ART
panel I-ART
beside O
it O
. O


You O
are O
sitting O
on O
top O
of O
the O
exquisitely O
carved O
wooden O
dresser O
that O
houses O
Prince O
Charles' O
clothes O
, O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
ill O
named O
toys B-ART
close O
by O
. O
Far O
away O
is O
the O
little O
pest's O
bed O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O
there O
is O
by O
a O
long O
drop O
down O
, O
which O
your O
plastic B-ART
body O
could O
hardly O
countenance O
. O


You've O
tracked O
your O
quarry B-ART
to O
this O
small B-ART
clearing I-ART
in O
the O
woods B-ART
. O
Before O
you O
to O
the O
east O
is O
the O
hastily B-ART
constructed I-ART
shack B-ART
where O
you O
suspect O
they've O
hidden O
themselves O
. O
There O
is O
also O
, O
as O
always O
, O
a O
mailbox B-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
very O
long B-ART
road I-ART
. O
Houses B-ART
are O
on O
either O
side O
. O
They're O
standing O
still O
, O
while O
the O
road B-ART
runs O
north O
and O
south O
. O
Just O
to O
the O
south O
is O
your O
home B-ART
. O
In O
the O
distance O
to O
the O
north O
is O
the O
television B-ART
studio B-ART
. O


This O
is O
still O
a O
very O
long B-ART
road I-ART
. O
Houses B-ART
, O
despite O
not O
moving O
, O
have O
apparently O
followed O
you O
. O
A O
ways O
to O
the O
south O
is O
your O
home B-ART
. O
A O
ways O
to O
the O
north O
is O
the O
studio B-ART
. O
A O
ways O
to O
the O
east O
is O
someone's O
backyard O
, O
but O
you'd O
have O
to O
climb O
over O
their O
fence O
to O
get O
there O
, O
and O
I O
didn't O
implement O
a O
fence O
. O


Yes O
, O
it's O
still O
a O
long B-ART
road I-ART
, O
but O
you're O
almost O
here O
! O
Well O
, O
you O
are O
here O
, O
but O
here O
is O
not O
where O
you O
want O
to O
be O
. O
You O
are O
almost O
there O
! O
The O
television B-ART
studio B-ART
is O
just O
to O
the O
north O
. O
Your O
house B-ART
would O
be O
visible O
in O
the O
distance O
behind O
you O
if O
you O
turned O
around O
, O
but O
don't O
turn O
around O
! O
That's O
the O
wrong O
way O
! O


Even O
in O
your O
short O
absence O
, O
the O
castle O
has O
come O
to O
look O
strange O
to O
you O
again O
. O
The O
towers O
are O
so O
high O
that O
the O
tops O
are O
lost O
in O
cloud B-ART
, O
and O
looking O
east O
or O
west O
, O
you O
cannot O
see O
the O
furthest O
extent O
of O
the O
walls B-ART
. O


Open O
to O
a O
grey B-ART
sky I-ART
, O
from O
which O
a O
light B-ART
rain O
falls O
. O
You O
have O
never O
seen O
the O
courtyard O
otherwise O
it O
rains B-ART
in O
every O
season O
, O
winter O
or O
summer O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
lies O
beyond O
the O
moat O
. O


Many O
books B-ART
of O
precedent O
line O
these O
walls B-ART
, O
containing O
every O
kind O
of O
contract B-ART
that O
can O
be O
made O
to O
bind O
every O
kind O
of O
soul O
. O


Built O
for O
the O
bureaucratic O
offices O
of O
the O
palace O
. O
Inlaid O
in O
the O
floor O
is O
the O
map B-ART
of O
all O
the O
lands O
that O
once O
this O
palace O
commanded O
. O


The O
stairs B-ART
rise O
from O
here O
towards O
the O
upper O
rooms O
, O
and O
open O
out B-ART
onto O
the O
bare O
courtyard O
. O


You O
do O
not O
often O
come O
this O
way O
, O
into O
the O
older O
part O
of O
the O
castle O
, O
which O
is O
narrow O
and O
has O
a O
low O
roof O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
, O
and O
the O
ceiling O
too O
, O
are O
deep O
scarlet O
, O
the O
color O
of O
the O
old O
king O
and O
queen O
that O
ruled O
here O
two O
hundred O
fifty O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
there O
was O
still O
a O
kingdom O
. O


Locked O
in O
an O
iron B-ART
cage I-ART
are O
the O
house O
treasures B-ART
He O
showed O
them O
to O
you O
one O
rainy O
day O
, O
telling O
you O
their O
many O
histories O
. O


A O
little O
hexagonal O
room O
, O
from O
which O
you O
can O
see O
the O
moat B-ART
, O
the O
lawn B-ART
, O
and O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
forest B-ART
outside I-ART
. O
The O
windows B-ART
are O
narrow B-ART
, O
not O
much O
more O
than O
arrow O
slits O
. O


Here O
on O
the O
north O
wall B-ART
and O
the O
south O
are O
portraits B-ART
of O
historical O
events O
from O
times O
past O
the O

You're O
in O
the O
bedroom B-ART
dominated O
by O
an O
impressive O
four B-ART
poster I-ART

. O
You O
can't O
think O
of O
a O
nice O
way O
to O
describe O
the O
fussy O
floral B-ART
wallpaper I-ART
that O
smothers O
the O
walls B-ART
. O
The O
landing O
lies O
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O

expect O
including O
a O
toilet B-ART
, O
a O
sink B-ART
and O
a O
bath B-ART
, O
except O
this O
one O
has O
marble O
and O
chrome O
everywhere O
proving O
yet O
again O
that O
taste O

wealth O
are O
mutually O
exclusive O
. O
The O
landing O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You're O
in O
the O
study O
with O
a O
bookshelf B-ART
taking O
up O
much O
of O
the O
north O
wall B-ART
. O
An O
expensive O
writing B-ART
desk I-ART
takes O
pride O
of O

in O
the O

, O
positioned O
as O
it O
is O
, O
under O
the O

You're O

the O
trailer O
of O
the O
Sacrosanct's O

quite O
a O

the O

Your O
bedroom B-ART
isn't O
much O
to O
speak O
of O
drab O
beige O
walls B-ART
are O
largely O
hidden O
by O
a O
mess O
of O
random O
posters O
and O
furniture O
, O
and O
the O
furniture O
itself O
is O
hidden O
with O
a O
thick O
layer O
of O
general O
messiness O
. O
You're O
surprised O
to O
look O
around O
and O
not O
see O
any O
smoke O
in O
the O
air O
, O
because O
your O
olfactory O
bits O
are O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
smell O
of O
burnt O
toast O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
coming O
from O
the O
kitchen O
downstairs O
. O


The O
kitchen B-ART
is O
a O
bit O
more O
pleasing O
to O
the O
eye O
than O
your O
bedroom O
. O
The O
usual O
assortment O
of O
appliances O
and O
kitchen B-ART
implements O
are O
here O
, O
aside O
from O
a O
microwave O
you've O
really O
been O
wanting O
a O
microwave O
lately O
. O
You O
are O
still O
overwhelmed O
by O
this O
burnt O
toast O
smell O
, O
but O
can't O
see O
any O
smoke O
. O
The O
front O
door O
of O
your O
tiny O

You O
are O
in O
the O

a O

Some O

Others O
look O
at O
their O
books O
, O
pretending O
to O

. O


You O
are O
in O
your O
dorm B-ART
room O
, O
in O
Linnell O
House O
. O
It O
is O
bigger O
than O
a O
breadbox O
, O
but O
not O
by O
much O
. O
The O
door O
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


The O

a O
few O
anorexic O
shrubs B-ART

the O
red O

hell O
you O
call O
home O
. O
A O
muddy O
path O
leads O
north O

Your O
apartment B-ART
is O
minimalist O
just O
a O
desk O
, O
a O
chair O
and O
your O

awaiting O
you O
. O
The O
kitchen O
and O

are O
around O
the O
corner O
though O
you O
really O
don't O
have O
time O
to O
snack O
or O
take O
a O
nap O
right O
now O
. O
The O
front O
door O
is O
to O
the O

It's O
a O
fine O
evening O
outside B-ART
. O
Your O
antique O
car O
awaits O
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
come O
to O
think O
of O
it O
you're O
due O
at O
the O
filming O
of O
Antique O
Roadshow O
in O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
. O
You O
really O
should O
get O
going O
soon O
. O


The O
chalice B-ART
is O
the O
pride O
of O
the O
Museum's O
collection O
, O
and O
this O
room O
vault B-ART
is O
a O
more O
appropriate O
term O
, O
really O
is O
evidence O
of O
that O
. O
There O
is O
only O
one O
exit O
, O
to O
the O
south O
, O
which O
is O
sternly O
watched O
during O

hours O
and O
solidly O
locked O
at O
all O
other O
times O

This O
is O
an O
other O
time O
, O
and O
the O
heavy O
metallic O
door B-ART
looks O
quite O
firm O
. O


An O

A O
drab O
, O
gray O
looking O
room O
. O
Alongside O
the O
west O
wall O
is O
a O
bookcase B-ART
, O
filled O
with O
boring O
looking O
books O
that O
are O
written O
on O
seemingly O
any O
subject O
, O
as O
long O
as O
it's O
not O
interesting O
. O
There's O
a O
decorative B-ART
lamp B-ART
on O
a O
small B-ART
table I-ART
in O
a O
corner O
, O
near O
a O
plush B-ART

The O

those O
foosball B-ART
things O
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
there's O
a O
green B-ART
door I-ART
leading O
to O
the O
hallway O
. O


This O
bathroom B-ART
must O
be O
the O
most O
putrid O
thing O
you've O
ever O
smelled O
. O
There O
are O
some O
urinals B-ART
along O
one O
wall O
, O
some O
sinks B-ART
along O
the O
other O
, O
a O
funky O
looking O

and O
some O

near O
the O

A O
small O
, O
plainly O
decorated O
room O
. O
It O
has O
a O
coat O
rack O
in O
the O
corner O
. O
During O
the O
party O
, O
there O
will O
probably O
be O
somebody O
stationed O
here O
to O
greet O
the O
guests O
. O
To O
the O
north O
is O
the O
hallway O
, O
to O
the O

is O
a O
black B-ART

this O
one O
is O
for O
eating O

It O
has O
plush O

white O

The O
Christmas O
banners O
haven't O
made O
their O
advance O
on O
this O
room O
yet O
, O
but O
it's O
probably O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
. O
Tables B-ART
and I-ART
chairs I-ART
are O
stacked O
along O
one O

Laughter O
, O
colors B-ART

the O
smell B-ART
of I-ART

a O
cool B-ART

The O
carnival B-ART
surrounds O
you O
to O
all O
sides O
. O
There O
are O
booths B-ART
all O
around O
you O
, O
where O
you O
can O
win O
giant O
stuffed O
animals O
for O
only O
a O
one O
dollar B-ART
investment O
. O
Signs B-ART
point O
this O
way O
and O
that O
, O
leading O
you O
to O
the O
strongest B-ART
man I-ART
in O
the O
world O
or O
the O
bearded B-ART
lady I-ART
. O
You O
nose B-ART
tells O
you O
that O
the O
food B-ART
vendors I-ART
can't O
be O
far O
away O
. O
The O
crowds B-ART
push O
in O
from O
all O
sides O
, O
but O
you O
can O
try O
to O
push O
past O
them O
in O
any O
directions O
. O


People B-ART
surround O
you O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
and O
you're O
not O
sure O
which O
direction O
is O
which O
. O
You're O
not O
really O
worried O
though O
everybody O
around O
you O
seems O
to O
be O
having O
fun O
, O
and O
you O
didn't O
have O
any O
pressing O
engagements O
. O


There's O
set O
of O
colored O
targets B-ART
here O
, O
behind O
a O
long O
counter B-ART
. O
There's O
no O
one O
here O
to O
take O
your O
money O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
big B-ART
sign I-ART
on O
the O
counter B-ART
. O
Next O
to O
the O
targets B-ART
is O
a O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
cute I-ART
stuffed I-ART
animals I-ART

You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
bare O
room O
. O
There O
is O
a O
steel O
door B-ART
to O
the O
west O
and O
another O
room O
to O
the O
east O

There O
is O
a O

The O
room O
has O
faint O
wine O

Although O
not O
quite O
bare O

it O
still O
has O
relatively O
few O

A O

the O
corner O
and O
a O
big B-ART
wooden O

at O
the O

of O
the O

Judging O
by O
the O
dust B-ART
, O
this O
room O
hasn't O
been O
used O
in O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O

This O

outside I-ART
the O
Badger O

The O
street B-ART
extends O
east O

west O
, O
but O
nothing O
of O
interest O
lies O
there O
your O
path O
to O

is O
through O
the O

Sinks B-ART

There O

A O

a O
quaint O

shadowed B-ART
village B-ART

The O
room O
is O
small O
and O
richly O
carpeted B-ART
. O
Or O
maybe O
it's O
a O
tent O
. O
There's O
a O
hint O
of O

tapestries B-ART
in O
the O

After O
numerous O
adventures O
you O
have O
penetrated B-ART
the O
very O
centre O
of O
the O
Temple O
, O
to O
this O
tiny O
little O
vault O
where O
the O
cursed O
dessert O
lies O
. O
The O
room O
is O
small O
and O
unordained O
, O
unlike O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
temple O
, O
with O
just O
crumbly O
yellow O
bricks O
forming O
the O

Bouncing O

a O

the O
harsh O
bite O
of O
Chen's B-ART
cigarette B-ART
burns O
in O
your O
lungs O
as O
his O
smoking O
fills O
the O
jeep B-ART

There's O
dick O
all O
to O
see O
here O
, O
even O
with O
the O

You're O
in O
mid O
air B-ART
, O
falling O
fast O
. O
You O
can't O
see O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
there's O
nothing O
to O
see O
in O
the O
sky O
. O


You O
still O
can't O
see O
anything O
with O
your O
faceplate B-ART
covered O
with O
slime O

First O
base O

It's O
where O
everything B-ART
starts O
, O
isn't O
it O
? O
Well O
, O
in O
this O
case O
, O
it O
really O
started O
on O
the O
pitcher's O
mound O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
exciting O
there O
, O
so O
maybe O
you'll O
have O
better O
luck O
here O

Sweetness B-ART
fills O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
High B-ART
Wall I-ART
to O
your O
east O
. O
Under O
this O
sweetness B-ART
lies O
a O
small B-ART
expanse O
of O
fod B-ART
. O
A O
mobile B-ART
releases O
mildly O
to O
the O
west O
; O
far O
in O
that O
direction O
a O
tower B-ART
proudly O
plants O
itself O
, O
while O
the O
ground B-ART
rises O
more O
slowly O
to O
the O
south O
and O
relaxes O
to O
the O
north O
. O


The O
wall B-ART
to O
your O
east O
continues O
to O
gain O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
To O
your O
north O
is O
a O
massive O
transparent O
cube B-ART
, O
perhaps O
five O
of O
your O
heights O
on O
each B-ART
side O
. O
Retreats O
lie O
west O
and O
south O
. O


By O
the O
mobile O
south O
, O
a O
rounded O
hole B-ART
, O
five O
times O
as O
wide O
as O
you O
are O
tall O
, O
deepens O
through O
the O
earth B-ART
. O
Its O
dark O
is O
deeper O
than O
that O
around O
you O
. O
The O
east O
is O
also O
passable O
. O


The O
land O
increases O
towards O
your O
head O
to O
the O
south O
, O
and O
decreases O
away O
from O
your O
feet O
to O
the O
north O
. O
Mobiles O
lead O
accordingly O
in O
both B-ART
directions O
. O
The O
High B-ART
Wall I-ART
may O
also O
be O
approached O
to O
the O
east O
. O
A O
long O
walk O
to O
the O
west O
is O
a O
tower B-ART
, O
dwarfing O
your O
form O
, O
and O
dwarfed O
in O
turn O
by O
the O
wall B-ART
. O


Dun O
tumbles O
down O
loosely O
from O
a O
steep O
hill B-ART
to O
the O
south O
, O
sliced O
through O
by O
the O
wall B-ART
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
mobile O
from O
the O
north O
ends O
as O
the O
land's O
slope O
increases O
too O
greatly O
. O
Dirt B-ART
glistens O
blue B-ART
. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
amid O
the O
land O
, O
a O
way O
opens O
into O
darkness O
, O
while O
more O
ground B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
east O
. O


A O
stone B-ART
tower I-ART
rises O
high B-ART
and O
west O
above O
you O
, O
surrounded O
by O
a O
ring O
of O
stamped O
dirt B-ART
. O
An O
archway O
faces O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
strangely O
small B-ART
compared O
to O
the O
tower's B-ART
bulk O
; O
one O
must O
almost O
duck O
to O
transcend O
it O
. O
A O
plaque B-ART
is O
set O
above O
the O
archway O
, O
approaching O
its O
size O
. O


The O
inside O
of O
the O
tower B-ART
is O
completely O
void O
, O
nothing O
remaining O
but O
a O
long O
spiral O
staircase B-ART
rising O
through O
the O
ceiling B-ART
far O
above O
. O
The O
plain O
awaits O
to O
the O
east O
. O


When O
viewed O
, O
as O
now O
, O
from O
four O
stories O
above O
the O
ground B-ART
and O
an O
equal O
distance O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
tower B-ART
, O
these O
stairs B-ART
are O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
universe O
. O
Far O
above O
, O
they O
penetrate O
an O
opening O
in O
the O
stone B-ART
ceiling I-ART
. O


You O
stand O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
desert O
on O
a O
sand B-ART
deposit O
so O
large O
there O
is O
no O
dune O
in O
sight O
. O
Only O
the O
bright O
whitish O
sun B-ART
hangs O
as O
the O
center O
piece O
to O
a O
boring O
portrait O
; O
A O
portrait O
you O
are O
not O
so O
sure O
if O
you O
are O
a O
part O
of O
. O
The O
sky B-ART
glows O
a O
solemn O
blue O
turning O
into O
nothing O
but O
a O
haze O
as O
the O
horizon O
meets O
the O
burnt O
sand B-ART
. O


You O
almost O
walk O
yourself O
right O
off O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
cliff O
before O
embracing O
a O
rock O
to O
hold O
you O
back O
. O
It's O
as O
if O
this O
cliff O
divides O
what O
is O
real O
and O
what O
isn't O
. O
From O
a O
certain O
angle O
you O
wouldn't O
even O
know O
it O
is O
there O
. O
You O
can't O
make O
out B-ART
what O
is O
below B-ART
except O
for O
a O
haziness O
drenched O
in O
mystery O
. O


You O
find O
yourself O
on O
the O
inside O
of O
a O
white O
coffee O
mug O
. O
If O
it O
wasn't O
for O
the O
faint O
breeze O
of O
a O
diner O
fan O
above B-ART
you O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
tell O
where O
you O
were O
. O
It O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
the O
contents O
of O
this O
cup B-ART
have O
been O
drunk O
already O
although O
you O
can O
still O
make O
out B-ART
the O
scent O
of O
a O
freshly O
poured O
cup B-ART
of O
Joe O
. O
An O
enormous O
spoon B-ART
, O
by O
comparison O
to O
your O
newly O
found O
size O
, O
rests O
against O
the O
rim O
and O
extends O
down O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
cup B-ART
. O


All O
lights O
in O
the O
diner O
seem O
extraordinarily O
dim O
. O
The O
jukebox B-ART
in O
the O
corner O
glows O
yellow O
and O
red O
and O
purple O
casting O
its O
colors O
onto O
the O
table B-ART
and I-ART
pictures I-ART
on O
the O
walls O
. O
Only O
barstools B-ART
and O
a O
bar B-ART
stand O
in O
this O
diner O
. O
It O
is O
a O
cramped O
little O
place O
not O
unlike O
a O
sort O
of O
hopeless O
retreat O
for O
the O
sinners O
and O
loners O
. O


An O
old B-ART
woman I-ART
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
street O
beckons O
you O
to O
hear O
her O
plead O
for O
forgiveness O
. O
Her O
gaze O
does O
not O
lie O
on O
you O
however O
, O
but O
rather O
at O
the O
cobblestone O
below B-ART
, O
still O
damp O
and O
reflecting O
the O
faint O
yellow O
glow O
from O
the O
streetlight B-ART
. O
You O
stand O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
a O
boutique B-ART
and O
butcher's O
shop B-ART
. O
Tenements B-ART
covered O
in O
grime O
and O
accessed O
through O
bolted O
doors O
prove O
this O
street's O
vacancy O
. O


Your O
surroundings O
shift O
into O
a O
dark O
red O
mystical O
blur O
with O
a O
gigantic O
iron O
vat B-ART
in O
the O
middle O
. O
You O
gag O
as O
you O
waft O
the O
contents B-ART
of O
the O
cauldron B-ART
but O
a O
faint O
light O
appears O
among O
the O
murky O
goo B-ART
. O
You O
hear O
whispers O
and O
make O
out B-ART
what O
seems O
to O
be O
eyelids B-ART
flashing O
open O
all O
around O
you O
. O
You O
make O
out B-ART
what O
can O
only O
be O
described O
as O
pulsing O
veins B-ART
in O
the O
grey O
mist O
illuminated O
in O
red O
. O
A O
pedestal B-ART
stands O
to O
the O
northwest O
of O
the O
cauldron B-ART
. O

who O

Westbound O

you O

You O
are O
in O
the O
northern B-ART
zone I-ART
of O
the O

Even O
here O
the O

of O
the O

that O

Towards O

there O
is O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
cinema O
, O
towards O
the O
east O
a O
small O
square O
, O
towards O
the O
north O
a O
crossroad O
, O
while O
towards O
the O
south O
you O
go O
back O
to O
the O
south O
zone B-ART
of O
the O
street B-ART
. O


You've O
reached O
the O
crossroad B-ART
where O
the O
main O
street O
meets O
Liberty O
Road O
on O
the O
west O
and O
Sun B-ART
Street O
on O
the O
east O
. O
The O
stands B-ART
of O
the O
book O

are O
everywhere O
, O
but O
your O
attention O
is O
drawn O
to O
the O
fur O
coats O
shop O
you O
can O
see O
towards O
the O
north O
. O
To O
go O
back O
to O
the O

you O

You O
are O
on O
Liberty B-ART
Road I-ART
, O
always O
surrounded O
by O
the O
stands B-ART
of O
the O
book O

Towards O
the O

there O
is O
the O

the O

, O
while O
towards O
the O
east O
you O
go O
back O
to O
the O
crossroad O
on O
the O
main O

. O


You've O
entered O
into O
a O
luxurious O
fur O
coats B-ART
shop I-ART
, O
whose O
windows B-ART
are O
filled O
with O
furs B-ART
of O
every O
type O
, O
including O
a O
very O
rare O
kind O
manufactured O
with O
mosquito O
hairs O
. O
Oddly O
enough O
, O
there O
aren't O
cat O
furs B-ART
, O
but O
you O
are O
glad O
that O
those O
adorable O
felines O
have O
been O
saved O
from O
a O
trend O
that O
every O
year O
causes O
the O
death O
of O
millions O
of O
animals O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Towards O
the O
south O
you O
go O
back O
to O
the O
crossroad O
that O
faces O
the O
main O
street O
, O
while O
towards O
the O
north O
there O
is O
a O
passage B-ART
that O
should O
lead O
you O
to O
the O
back O
section O
of O
the O
shop B-ART
. O


You've O
reached O
the O
gazebo O
of O
the O
Oasis B-ART
of O
the O
Flavour B-ART
, O
a O
space O
displaying O
all O
sorts O
of O
good O
things O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
, O
aiming O
to O
promote O
the O
most O
delicious O
local O
products B-ART
through O
generous O
samples B-ART
offered O
to O
the O
people O
passing O
by O
. O
However O
, O
the O
most O
tempting O
thing O
on O
display O
is O
the O
girl B-ART
behind O
the O
table O
who O
prepares O
the O
samples B-ART
and O
smiles O
to O
everybody O
who O
takes O
one O
. O
Towards O
the O
east O
you O
come O
back O
to O
Liberty O
Road O
. O


It O
is O
dark B-ART
and O
stuffy O
and O
you O
are O
covered B-ART
over O
, O
something B-ART
is O
all O
draped O
over O
you O
, O
it O
is O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
crazy O
. O


This O
is O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
living O
room O
, O
it O
is O
all O
big O
and O
vast O
. O
But O
it O
would O
be O
bigger O
and O
vaster O
if O
there O
weren't O
all O
these O
pillows B-ART
and I-ART
stuff I-ART
in O
a O
big O
ring B-ART
around O
you O
. O


The O
roadside B-ART
is O
dusty B-ART
and O
dirty O
, O
with O
sand B-ART
blowing O
all O
around O
you O
in O
little O
dust B-ART
devils I-ART
. O
The O
two O
lane O
road B-ART
stretches O
east O
and O
west O
as O
far O
as O
the O
eye O
can O
see O
. O
Corn B-ART
fields I-ART
fill O
the O
horizon O
on O
boths B-ART
sides B-ART
of O
the O
road B-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
beside O
a O
large O
road B-ART
heavily O
frequented O
by O
cars B-ART
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
but O
desert O
in O
all O
directions O
. O


The O
garish O
facade B-ART
of O
the O
Chunky B-ART
Chicken I-ART
Poultry I-ART
Palace I-ART
is O
behind O
you O
, O
and O
across O
the O
street B-ART
is O
the O
only O
bank B-ART
for O
miles O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
by O
the O
side O
of O
a O
rather O
narrow O
lane B-ART
seemingly O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nowhere O
. O
Fields B-ART
of I-ART
corn I-ART
and O
wheat O
line O
your O
side O
of O
the O
road O
as O
far O
as O
the O
eye O
can O
see O
. O
The O
other O
side O
of O
the O
dusty B-ART
road O
seems O
much O
the O
same O
except O
for O
looking O
a O
bit O
greener O
. O
Everything B-ART
would O
seem O
normal O
, O
albeit O
a O
bit O
boring O
, O
except O
for O
the O
television O
cameras B-ART
that O
appear O
to O
be O
hovering O
in O
the O
air O
twenty O
feet O
above O
your O
head O
. O


You're O
standing O
on O
the O
south O
side O
of O
the O
road B-ART
you O
need O
to O
cross O
, O
an O
array O
of O
orange B-ART
traffic I-ART
cones I-ART
before O
you O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
maze O
of O
orange B-ART
traffic I-ART
cones I-ART
, O
all O
alike O
. O
Passages O
lead O
out O
to O
the O
west O
, O
east O
, O
and O
south O
. O


Here O
above O
the O
cones B-ART
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
road B-ART
seems O
tantalizingly O
close O
. O


You O
stand O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
gravelly B-ART
clearing O
, O
surrounded O
on O
all O
sides O
by O
desolate O
underbrush O
the O
kind O
of O
desolate O
underbrush O
one O
finds O
in O
desolate O
states O
such O
as O
Wyoming O
or O
Rhode O
Island O
. O
The O
sun O
burns O
hot O
overhead O
, O
giving O
the O
whole O
place O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
a O
giant O
deep O
fat O
fryer O
or O
something O
. O


A O
man's O
home O
is O
his O
castle O
. O
Your O
home O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
depressing O
shack O
at O
the O
base O
of O
a O
vermin O
infected O
apartment O
complex O
, O
well O
within O
the O
grimy O
arabic O
district O
. O
The O
pungent O
odor O
of O
last O
night's B-ART
dinner B-ART
fills O
the O
air O
you O
left B-ART
the O
chinese B-ART
food I-ART
on O
your O
desk O
which O
is O
right O
next O
to O
your O
heater B-ART
. O
The O
food B-ART
ripened O
quite O
nicely O
overnight B-ART
. O


The O
building O
is O
dull O
concrete O
; O
the O
name O
is O
stolen O
from O
a O
graduate O
dormitory O
. O
Your O
lab O
is O
one O
of O
a O
row O
of O
identical O
cells O
; O
shared O
by O
four O
students O
, O
the O
room O
is O
cluttered O
with O
equipment O
and O
papers O
. O
A O
warm O
May O
breeze O
drifts O
through O
the O
window B-ART
. O


Overflowing O
file B-ART
cabinets I-ART
and O
cluttered O
bulletin B-ART
boards I-ART
everywhere O
. O
Some O

are O
yellow O
with O

What O
started B-ART
as O
a O
natural O
canyon O
has O
been O
widened O
into O
a O
ship B-ART
landing O
site O
. O
Light O
gray B-ART
rhyolite O
surrounds O
you O
, O
roughly O
flattened O
, O
walls B-ART
carved O
out O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O
Your O
ship B-ART
rests O
to O
the O
south O
on O
its O
landing O
treads O
. O
To O
the O
north O
is O
a O
narrow O
defile O
to O
the O
main O
complex O
that O
you've O
been O
assigned O
to O
investigate O
. O


You O
are O
contained O
within O
four O
walls B-ART
, O
a O
ceiling B-ART
and O
a O
floor O
; O
a O
room B-ART
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
special O
about O
this O
room B-ART
, O
which O
is O
maybe O
why O
it O
feels O
so O
strange O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
to O
remember O
it O
by O
, O
save O
the O
video B-ART
recorder I-ART
in O
the O
centre O
; O
so O
we O
could O
call O
this O
room B-ART
the O
' O
video B-ART
room' I-ART
. O
But O
as O
there O
are O
no O
other O
rooms B-ART
around O
there's O
no O
need O
to O
be O
so O
specific O
. O
Lets O
just O
call O
it O
'the O
room' B-ART
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
spacious O
foyer B-ART
of O
the O
MegaCorp O
Building O
. O
The O
room O
gives O
you O
the O
feeling O
of O
businesslike O
detachment O
. O


It's O
the O
dim O
, O
austere O
chapel B-ART
of O
the O
funeral O
home O
. O
Even O
though O
you've O
worked O
here O
for O
the O
past O
ten O
years O
, O
you O
never O
quite O
get O
over O
the O
spookiness O
. O


This O
is O
a O
small O
room B-ART
. O
Felix B-ART
and O
you O
are O
sitting O
on O
chairs B-ART
at O
a O
table B-ART
in O
his O
party B-ART
room I-ART
. O
On O
the O
table B-ART
you O
can O
see O
a O
newspaper B-ART
and O
a O
radio B-ART
. O
You O
hear O
music B-ART
from O
the O
radio B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
door B-ART
closed O
and O
you O
can O
leave O
the O
room B-ART
by O
going O
outside B-ART
. O


Of O
all O
the O
places O
in O
the O
world O
to O
obtain O
the O
sweet O
goodness B-ART
of I-ART
Coca I-ART

products O
, O
this O
has O
to O
be O
your O
favorite O

The O
Coke B-ART
machine I-ART
dominates O
the O
landscape O
, O
resting O
snugly O
against O
the O
perfect O
brick O
wall B-ART
next O
to O
the O
unbroken O
sidewalk O
, O
which O
seems O
to O
lead O
to O
untold O
possibilities O
, O
their O
potential O
unlocked O
by O
the O
mere O
presence O
of O
Coca B-ART

Your O
home O
is O
two O
rooms O
of O
dressed O
timber O
, O
but O
the O
roof O
doesn't O
leak O
, O
so O
that's O
fine O

Not O
enough O
of O
a O
fortress O
to O
keep O
out O
the O
piskeys O
, O
though O
, O
it O
seems O
. O
The O
front O

is O
where O
you O

You O

A O
small B-ART
office O
with O
cherry B-ART
wood I-ART
walls I-ART
, O
it O
would O
seem O
rather O
cozy O
and O
pleasant O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
clutter B-ART

litter I-ART
of O
the O

You O
are O
amused O
to O
find O
yourself O
in O
a O
thoroughly O
modern O
kitchen B-ART
, O
its O
walls B-ART
positively O
spattered O
with O
yellow O
batter B-ART
and I-ART
white I-ART

In O
the O

a O
small B-ART

of I-ART
dirty I-ART

various O
black B-ART

In O
this O

a O

the O

Though O
you O

here O
late B-ART

it O
looks O
like O
those O
who O
came O
before O

a O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
last O
game B-ART
has O
finally O
been O
collected O

leaving O
the O

in O
a O

on O
the O

scarcity O
of O

is O
the O
main O
feature O
in O
this O
room O
the O
blank O
, O
empty O
wall B-ART
to O
the O
west O
is O
the O
epitome O
of O
this O
fact O
. O
However O
, O
there O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
objects O
of O
importance O
that O
lie O
to O
the O
north O
, O
one O
of O
which O
you O
will O
be O
shamefully O
acquainted O
with O
soon O
. O


The O
blank O
, O
naked O
plaster O
wall B-ART
stares O
back O
at O
you O
shamefully O
; O
its O
outer O
coverings O
have O
been O
stripped O
off O
completely O
, O
exposing O
its O
full O
, O
bare O
surface O
. O
Long O
, O
fuzzy O
bicycle B-ART
shadows I-ART
and O
the O
pathetic O
shadow O
of O
yourself O
are O
the O
only O
images O
on O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
the O
light B-ART
from O
the O
lamp B-ART
from O
up O
behind O
you O
diffusing O
onto O
the O

The O

of O

Since O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
garage O
are O
further O
away O
from O
the O
central O
overhead B-ART
lamp I-ART
, O
there O
is O
much O
more O
shadow O
and O
darkness O
over O
here O
. O
But O
that O
does O
not O
matter O
, O
because O
you O
already O
know O
what O
is O
here O
other O
than O
the O
huge O
poster B-ART
occupying O
the O
center B-ART
, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
on O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
save O
for O
a O
metallic B-ART
control O
box B-ART
with O
a O

on O
it O
lying O
next O

Around O
the O

corner O
of O
the O
chained B-ART

behind O
you O
, O
you O
can O
also O
make O
your O
way O
towards O
the O
workbench B-ART
, O
which O
from O
here O
is O
to O
the O

The O
glowier O
, O
and O
much O
redder O
part O
of O
the O

is O
back O

You O
are O
in O
your O
comfortable O
living O
room O
. O
There O
is O
a O
room O
to O
the O
north O
and O
stairs O
to O
the O
west O
. O
You O
see O
a O
comfortable O
sofa B-ART
which O
has O
the O
book B-ART
and I-ART
cushions I-ART
on O
it O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
your O
steep O
and O
narrow O
staircase B-ART
. O
It O
goes O
from O
your O
living O
room O
to O
the O
upstairs O
. O


You O
are O
in O
your O
brand O
new O
gourmet O
kitchen B-ART
! O
To O
the O
south O
is O
your O
pleasant O
living O
room O
. O


The O
makeshift O
cell O
is O
dust O
choked O
and O
filled O
with O
a O
jumble B-ART
of I-ART
machine I-ART
parts I-ART
, I-ART
boilers I-ART
and I-ART
scrap I-ART
metal I-ART
. O
This O
room O
is O
old O
much O
older O
than O
the O
Hedonan O
prison O
compound O
that O
has O
been O
built O
on O
top O
of O
it O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
debris B-ART
looks O
like O
it O
has O
been O
here O
since O
the O
Nuclear O
War O
. O


The O
prison O
is O
quite O
primitive O
, O
almost O
like O
a O
cave O
hewn O
out O
of O
rock B-ART
. O
Since O
the O
prison O
was O
built O
on O
a O
rocky B-ART
island O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
sea O
air O
is O
quite O
strong O
amidst O
the O
smell O
of O
mildew O
and O
the O
stench O
of O
unwashed O
bodies O
. O
A O
small O
window B-ART
situated O
near O
the O
ceiling B-ART
allows O
some O
sunlight O
in O
. O
A O
door B-ART
leading O
out O
of O
the O
prison O
is O
to O
your O
north O
. O


This O
is O
the O
Harpsichord O
Room O
. O
You O
persist O
in O
calling O
it O
that O
, O
even O
though O
the O
titular O
instrument O
has O
long O
since O
been O
smashed O
to O
bits O
, O
it O
and O
its O
dreadful O
curse O
. O
You O
must O
admit O
that O
the O
room O
is O
quite O
devoid O
of O
life O
without O
it O
; O
you O
even O
tore O
the O
curtains O
from O
the O
windows B-ART
after O
that O
terrible O
night O
, O
lest O
the O
slightest O
stain O
of O
Wilbur's O
blood O
incriminate O
you O
. O
Now O
the O
only O
features O
are O
a O
decorative O
end B-ART
table I-ART
in O
the O
corner O
, O
a O
set O
of O
stairs O
leading O
to O
the O
room O
above O
, O
a O
trapdoor B-ART
in O
the O
floor O
and O
a O
door O
in O
the O
east O
wall B-ART
that O
leads O
outside B-ART
. O


You O
have O
been O
spending O
an O
increasingly O
large O
amount O
of O
time O
in O
the O
basement O
. O
The O
once O
intimidating O
rock O
walls B-ART
and O
ancient O
foundations O
of O
previous O
buildings O
now O
seem O
familiar O
and O
comforting O
. O
The O
only O
way O
out B-ART
is O
a O
well O
trodden O
set O
of O
stone O
steps O
leading O
upwards O
. O


The O
bedroom B-ART
was O
never O
well O
maintained O
, O
even O
when O
Wilbur O
was O
alive O
. O
Now O
it O
hasn't O
been O
cleaned O
for O
some O
time O
, O
and O
thick O
films O
of O
dust O
and O
filth O
cover O
everything B-ART
. O
You're O
almost O
certain O
rats O
are O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
you O
cannot O
bring O
yourself B-ART
to O
care O
. O
Only O
the O
ancient O
bed B-ART
and O
your O
old O
writing B-ART
desk I-ART
show O
any O
sign O
of O
recent O
use O
. O


You O
are O
in O
an O
utterly O
featureless O
white O
room O

Everything B-ART
is O
painted O
a O
flat O

spotless O

shining O
white O
. O
The O
fluorescent O
ceiling O
lights O
merge O
seamlessly O
with O
the O
paintwork O
, O
brightly O
illuminating O
the O
room O
. O
You O
can't O
even O
see O
where O
the O
door O
was O
, O
so O
utterly O
flawless O
is O
the O
constant O
white O
. O


Everything O
about O
the O
New O
Delhi O
Mental O
Hospital O
screams O
surgical O

The O
uncarpeted O
floor O
is O
so O
sterilised O
you O
almost O
feel O
guilty O
walking O
on O
it O
. O
There O
are O
no O
corners O
in O
the O
architecture O
the O
walls B-ART
are O
curved O

painted O
an O

The O

stretches O
hugely O
off O

standing O
at O

leaning O
over O
the O

with O
your O
elbows O
resting O
on O
the O
surface O

Much O
of O
the O
wall B-ART

you O
is O
decorated O
with O
a O
suitably O
pacifying O
work O
of O

You O

object O
at O

an O

You O
are O
standing O
before O
a O
bizarre O
machine B-ART

bizarre O
beyond O
description O
. O
The O
bits O
of O
it O
that O
seem O
most O

to O
be O
of O

are O
a O
large B-ART
red I-ART

a O

From O
overhead O
the O
sun B-ART

the O

sand B-ART
around O
your O

as O
you O

In O
the O
shade O
of O
a O
tall O
dune O
is O
this O
stand O
of O
olive B-ART

The O
wind B-ART
has O
slowed O

This O
old B-ART
road I-ART
, O
coming O
from O
the O

runs O
north O
to O
the O
edge O

the O

Alongside O
it O
to O

the O
rushing B-ART
water B-ART
of O
the O
river B-ART
Aarkland I-ART

The O
river B-ART
flows I-ART
through O
the O

divides O
it O
in O
two B-ART

the O
east O
is O
the O

to O
the O

over O
ten B-ART

The O
river B-ART
runs O
from O
north O

Ahead O

the O

a O

The O
dusty O
road B-ART
is O
east O
, O
where O
she B-ART
can O
get O
out B-ART
of O
the O
water B-ART
. O
She B-ART
can O
also O
dive O
down O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
river B-ART

There's O
a O
sudden O
splash O
just O
behind O
Lornedei B-ART
. O
She B-ART
turns O
around O
in O
the O
water B-ART
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
there O
but O
some O
quickly O
fading O
rings O
on O
the O
surface B-ART
. O


A O
magical O
world O
reveals O
itself O
. O
The O
river B-ART
continues O
north O
. O
The O
bottom B-ART
is O
mostly O
composed O
of O
sand B-ART
, I-ART
rocks I-ART
, O
some O
mud B-ART
, O
and O
quickly O
fleeing O
fish O
. O
All O
kinds O
of O
things O
have O
been O
thrown O
in O
the O
river B-ART
from O
the O
road O
and O
are O
now O
resting O
under O
a O
layer O
of O
sand B-ART
until O
the O

The O
forbidden B-ART
forest I-ART
is O
to O
the O
west O
and O
the O
old O
forest B-ART
to O
the O
east O
. O
The O
river B-ART
flows I-ART
back O
south O
and O
down O
takes O
her O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
river B-ART
. O
To O
the O
north O
the O
river B-ART
disappears O
out B-ART
of O
sight O
around O
a O
bend O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
slight O
opening B-ART
in O
the O
trees B-ART
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
grass B-ART
grows O
waist O
high O
. O
Touched O
by O
sun B-ART
, O
wind O
, O
and O
rain O
, O
it O
patiently O
waits O
for O
the O
farmers O
that O
will O
not O
come O
. O
The O
edge O
of O
the O
old B-ART
forest I-ART
lies O
close O
by O
to O
the O
north O
. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
a O
big B-ART
pile I-ART
of I-ART
stones I-ART
rises O
above B-ART
the O
grass B-ART
. O
The O
road B-ART
is O
back O
west O
. O


It's O
harder O
to O
see O
here O
. O
The O
river B-ART
flows O
from O
north O
to O
south O
. O
The O
mud B-ART
swirls O
up O
, O
preventing O
her O
from O
seeing O
more O
than O
a O
few O
arm O
lengths O
ahead O
. O
The O
old O
trees O
reach O
out B-ART
their O
roots B-ART
under O
the O
water B-ART
. O
They O
crowd B-ART
the O
bottom B-ART
along O
with O
swaying B-ART
vegetation I-ART
and I-ART
rocks I-ART
. O


A O
narrow B-ART
path I-ART
leads O
east O
into O
the O
forest B-ART
. O
All O
is O
still O
. O
The O
old O
forest B-ART
surrounds O
her O
. O


A O
dry O
black B-ART
leaf I-ART
drops O
down O
on O
Lornedei's B-ART
shoulder O
. O
With O
a O
grimace O
, O
she B-ART
flicks O
it O
with O
a O
finger B-ART
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it O
. O


A O
dry O
black B-ART
leaf I-ART
drops O
from O
the O
forbidden B-ART
forest I-ART
into O
the O
water B-ART
right O
in O
front O
of O
Lornedei B-ART
. O
It O
bobs O
up O
and O
down O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
before O
it O
floats O
away O
downstream O
. O


The O
river B-ART
makes O
a O
slight O
turn O
, O
hiding O
the O
road O
from O
view O
. O
A O
vertical B-ART
cliff I-ART
stops O
her O
from O
going O
any O
further O
north O
in O
this O
tunnel O
of O
water B-ART
, I-ART
trees I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
shadows I-ART
. O
Above B-ART
her O
head O
is O
a O
frayed O
ribbon O
of O
blue O
sky B-ART
and O
at O
the O
top B-ART
of O
the O
cliff B-ART
, O
the O
two B-ART
forests I-ART
meet O
. O
Below B-ART
and O
around O
her O
there O
is O
that O
play O
of O
light O
and O
dark O
, O
maybe O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
darker O
. O
South O
takes O
her O
back O
around O
the O
bend B-ART
. O
Looking O
down O
she B-ART
can O
see O
an O
opening O
in O
the O
cliff B-ART
. O


The O
bottom B-ART
is O
littered O
with O
rocks B-ART
. O
There O
are O
piles O
of O
them O
of O
varying O
sizes O
, O
washed O
clean O
by O
the O
constant O
flow O
of O
water B-ART
. O
Around O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
opening B-ART
into O
the O
cave B-ART
, O
a O
few O
colonies O
of O
a O
slimy B-ART
and O
sickly O
green B-ART
plant O
have O
managed O
to O
make O
a O
home O
. O
They O
sway O
back O
and O
forth O
in O
the O
current O
while O
clinging O
desperately O
to O
the O
rocks B-ART
. O
The O
opening B-ART
leads O
northwest O
into O
a O
cave B-ART
and O
south O
takes O
her O
back O
around O
the O
river B-ART
bend O
. O


Darkness O
is O
chased O
away O
by O
only O
a O
few O
illusive O
reflections O
in O
the O
stone O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
little O
light B-ART
leaking O
in O
from O
the O
opening O
. O
The O
tunnel O
continues O
west O
into O
total O
darkness O
and O
Southeast O
takes O
her O
out B-ART
of O
the O
cave B-ART
. O


The O
clearing B-ART
is O
perfectly O
round O
and O
it's O
surrounded O
by O
the O
old B-ART
forest I-ART
in O
all O
directions O
. O
A O
giant B-ART
oak I-ART
tree I-ART
stands O
in O
solitude O
a O
short O
distance O
into O
the O
hall O
of O
trees B-ART
, O
separated O
from O
the O
wall O
of O
birch B-ART
, O
ash O
, O
silver O
pine B-ART
and O
the O
myriad O
of O
other O
plants O
growing O
there O
. O
The O
barely O
visible O
path B-ART
through O
the O
forest B-ART
is O
to O
the O
west O
. O


She O
is O
standing O
between O
the O
big B-ART
oak I-ART
and O
the O
dense O
forest O
. O
Southeast O
or O
southwest O
will O
take O
her O
back O
to O
the O
open O
clearing O
. O
Steps B-ART
are O
cut O
in O
the O
big B-ART
oak I-ART
. O


The O
shadow B-ART
of O
the O
big B-ART
oak I-ART
trembles O
on O
the O
ground B-ART
below I-ART
. O
The O
far O
end O
of O
the O
branch B-ART
Lornedei I-ART
is O
sitting O
on O
seems O
to O
disappear O
in O
a O
gray O
mist B-ART
. O
The O
other O
two B-ART
branches I-ART
on O
this O
level O
are O
just O
as O
unreachable O
for O
her O
as O
the O
limbs B-ART
higher O
up O

after O

it O
looks O
more O

a O

The O

the O
giant O
spiders B-ART
that O
surround O
you O
make O
for O
rather O
disquieting O
company O
, O
even O
for O
you O
. O
Although O
perfectly O
still O
and O
little O
more O
than O
stylised O
drawings O
, O
they O
appear O
to O
be O
extraordinarily O
alive O

shiny O

wide O
open O
mandibles B-ART

You O
are O
in O
a O
small O
painted O
black O
room O
that O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
temple B-ART
. O
You O
can O
see O
a O
kneeling B-ART
stool I-ART
in O
front O
of O
a O
large O
painting B-ART
with O
a O
golden O
frame B-ART
, O
hung O
on O
the O
back O
wall B-ART
. O
The O
subject O
of O
the O
picture B-ART
is O
Lilith O
, O
the O
gorgeous O
and O
cruel O
vampire O
who O
, O
more O
than O
a O
thousand O
years O
ago O
, O
threw O
you O
in O
this O
bloody O
abyss O
of O
darkness O
, O
letting O
you O
drink O
her O
blood O
after O
having O
pierced O
your O
jugular O
with O
her O
long O
, O
sharp O
canines O
so O
many O
times O
. O


The O
books B-ART
that O
fill O
the O
shelves B-ART
of O
your O
library B-ART
have O
been O
your O
best O
friends O
over O
the O
centuries O
. O
With O
their O
engaging O
stories O
they O
helped O
you O
to O
cope O
with O
the O
loneliness O
in O
which O
every O
vampire O
is O
forced O
to O
spend O
most O
of O
his O
life O
. O
At O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
room B-ART
is O
a O
desk B-ART
still O
covered O
with O
papers B-ART
; O
behind O
it O
you O
can O
see O
a O
priceless O
human B-ART
skin I-ART
armchair I-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
you O
return O
to O
the O
spiders O
room B-ART
. O


It's O
kind O
of O
messy O
here O
. O
You O
probably O
don't O
want O
to O
look O
much O
at O
your O
desk O
or O
your O
bed O
. O
You O
probably O
should O
just O
grab O
what O
you O
can O
and O
get O
going O
before O
going O
outside B-ART
. O


A O
quiet O
street O
, O
unsettlingly O
quiet O
at O
this O
time O
of O
night O
. O
The O
dim O
gaslights B-ART
barely O
penetrate O
the O
thick B-ART
fog I-ART
which O
has O
come O
rolling O
in O
on O
the O
Thames O
; O
you O
can't O
even O
see O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
street O
from O
here O
. O
A O
large O
poster B-ART
has O
been O
pasted O
next O
to O
the O
theatre O
entrance O
, O
which O
lies O
to O
the O

The O
tattered O
silk O
wallpaper B-ART
in O
this O
room O
was O
once O
a O
deep O
, O
rich O
red O
. O
Over O
the O
years O
it O
has O
faded O
to O
more O
of O
a O
livid O
, O
bruised O
maroon O
, O
betraying O
the O
current O
state O
of O
things O
at O
the O
Orpheum O
. O
The O
elegant O
inlays O
on O
the O
tile O
floor O
are O
scuffed O
and O
dingy O
, O
littered O
with O
crumpled O
playbills O
and O
the O
stubs O
of O
old O
cigars O
. O
Narrow O
staircases O
at O
each B-ART
end O
of O
the O

the O

The O

This O
long O

behind O
the O

is O
a O

of O

sundry O

of O

. O
A O

to O
the O

The O
light O
from O
the O
stage O
to O
the O
east O
makes O
shines O
through O
the O
rigging O
of O
the O
curtains O
and O
makes O
long O

strange O
shadows O
against O
the O
brick O
wall B-ART

A O
stairwell O
in O

Unlike O

Gleaming O

Several O

A O
big B-ART

in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

looks O
like O
a O
throne B-ART
and O
anyone O
sitting O
here O
must O
look O
very O
powerful O
indeed O
. O
It O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
is O
the O

of O
the O

This O

The O

more O
to O

the O

Rows O

the O

room O
schoolhouse B-ART
for O
dogs O
. O
Most O
of O
the O
room O
has O
been O
trashed O
by O
visiting O
dogs O
, O
but O
for O
some O
odd O
reason O
, O
there O
is O
a O
refrigerator B-ART
against O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
still O
running O
odd O
, O
since O
no O
one O
has O
paid O
the O
electric O
bill O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
. O


There O
is O
a O
large O
enclosed O
barn O
yard B-ART
here O
, O
to O
the O
east O
is O
a O
gate O
which O
leads O
to O
red O
barn O


You O
are O
standing O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
small O
pond B-ART
. O
The O
light O
breeze O
blowing O
today O
ripples O
the O
surface O
and O
makes O
this O
a O
very O
tranquil O
area O
. O
Towards O
the O
center O
of O
the O
pond B-ART
you O
can O
see O
circular O
ripples O
which O
are O
being O
made O
by O
some O
fish B-ART
feeding O
near O
the O
surface O
. O
Nearby O
you O
can O
see O
some O
tracks O
in O
the O
mud O
that O
were O
apparently O
made O
by O
the O
sheep O
when O
they O
come O
here O
to O
drink O
. O
There O
is O
also O
some O
other O
evidence B-ART
that O
the O
sheep O
stop O
by O
here O
regularly O
also O
namely O
sheep O
poop B-ART


You O
crouch O
in O
your O
wrath O
. O
The O
dark O
sky O
howls O
. O
Barrels B-ART
surround O
you O
. O


You're O
standing O
in O
a O
hallway O
that O
extends O
to O
the O
north O
and O
south O
, O
a O
single O
painting B-ART
the O
only O
feature O
adorning O
its O
walls B-ART
. O
The O
door B-ART
to O
the O
toilet O
is O
west O
. O


Your O
are O
standing O
at O
the O
front O
of O
your O
house B-ART
that's O
to O
the O
south O
in O
your O
normal O
and O
very O
beautiful O
neighborhood B-ART
. O
So O
beautiful O
in O
fact O
that O
it O
even O
got O
your O
lazy O
bum O
to O
start O
planting O
flowers B-ART
at O
your O
front O
home O
, O
just O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
your O
neighbors B-ART
. O
It O
was O
peak O
peace O
and O
joy O
, O
this O
place O
. O
Except O
for O
that O
thing O
. O


Since O
it's O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O
you're O
the O
only O
person O
here O
. O
This O
part O
time O
job O
as O
a O
janitor O
is O
a O
great O
coverup O
no O
one O
will O
ever O
figure O
out O
that O
you're O
a O
super O
spy O
from O
the O
future O
, O
who O
has O
returned O
to O
prevent O
the O
destruction O
of O
North O
Dakota O
. O
Unless O
they O
play O
this O
game O
, O
but O
how O
many O
people O
are O
likely O
to O
do O
that O
? O
The O
counter B-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
the O
exit O
is O
south O
. O


It O
was O
good O
fortune O
to O
find O
this O
abandoned O
hut B-ART
. O
Secluded O
, O
yet O
not O
far O
from O
Borphee O
or O
Pheebor O
, O
it O
is O
a O
perfect O
site O
for O
your O
new O
base O
of O
operations O
. O


This O
is O
a O
rocky B-ART
shore B-ART
along O
the O
north O
bank O
of O
The O
One O
River B-ART
. O
The O
surface B-ART
under O
your O
feet O
is O
hard O
and O
jagged O
which O
makes O
walking O
on O
it O
slightly O
difficult O
. O


As O
you O
look O
around O
, O
something O
catches O
your O
eye O
in O
the O
distance O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
It O
appears O
to O
be O
some O
kind O
of O
manmade O
structure B-ART
. O


The O
sand B-ART
on O
this O
quiet O
beach B-ART
is O
cool O
and O
moist O
and O
a O
welcome O
relief O
to O
your O
tired O
feet O
. O


This O
is O
a O
well O
traveled O
dirt O
road B-ART
which O
stretches O
as O
far O
as O
you O
can O
see O
in O
both B-ART
the O
east O
and O
west O
directions O
. O
There O
is O
also O
a O
small O
path O
leading O
south O
. O


The O
hungus B-ART
has O
nearly O
reached O
the O
south O
shore B-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
on O
a O
small O
patch B-ART
of I-ART
dry I-ART
land O
located O
on O
the O
western O
edge O
of O
a O
murky B-ART
swamp I-ART
. O
The O
One O
River B-ART
lies O
south O
, O
but O
you O
dare O
not O
go O
further B-ART
into O
the O
swamp B-ART
, O
for O
you O
will O
surely O
sink O
. O
The O
hungus B-ART
climbs O
up O
onto O
the O
south O
shore B-ART
of O
the O
river B-ART
and O
disappears O
into O
the O
bush B-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
long O
stretch O
of O
road O

before O
a O
large O
city O
gate O
which O
marks O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O

Two O
stone O
pillars O
adorn O
each B-ART
side O
of O
the O
east O
west O
road O
leading O
into O
the O

The O
pillars O
are O

by O
an O
ornate O
wrought O
iron O
archway O
with O
the O
name O
Pheebor O
proudly O
accented O
in O
gold O
leaf O

This O
is O
the O
City O
Plaza B-ART
A O
large B-ART
square O
which O
serves O
as O
the O
trade O
and O
cultural O
center O
of O
the O
city O
. O
Government O
buildings O
occupy O
the O
northeast O
, O
northwest O
and O
southwest O
corners O
of O
the O
square O
while O
, O
in O
the O
center O
, O
a O
large B-ART
stone I-ART
arch I-ART
is O
under O
construction O
. O
Two O
streets O
, O
one O
north O
, O
one O
west O
, O
cut O
between O
the O
buildings O
and O
into O
the O
city O

The O
south O
is O
bounded O
by O
a O
massive O
wall B-ART
which O
surrounds O
and O
fortifies O
the O
entire O
city O
while O
a O
large B-ART
gate O
leads O
out O
of O
the O
city O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
is O
the O
east O
end O
of O
River B-ART
Street I-ART
, O
which O
continues O
west O
from O
here O
. O
An O
alleyway B-ART
between O
buildings B-ART
to O
the O
south O
leads O
back O
to O
the O
Plaza O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
outside O
the O
Institute B-ART
of I-ART
Science I-ART
and I-ART
Technology I-ART
building O
. O
It O
is O
a O
very O
impressive O
building O
with O
large O
stone O
columns O
, O
and O
an O
open O
doorway O
. O


At O
the O
Institute O
, O
they O
don't O
waste O
much O
space O
on O
glamor O
or O
glitz O
. O
There O
is O
no O
foyer O
, O
no O
reception O
, O
no O
murals O
or O
mosaic O
tiled O
floor O
. O
Just O
a O
simple O
hallway O
with O
doors B-ART
lining O
the O
walls B-ART
on O
each B-ART
side O
. O
At O
the O
south O
end O
of O
the O
hall O
is O
the O
open O
doorway B-ART
, O
and O
at O
the O
north O
end O
is O
an O
elevator B-ART
. O


What O
first O
strikes O
you O
about O
Prof O
. O
Einboz' O
office O
is O
that O
it O
is O
as O
neat O
as O
a O
pin O
. O
Bookcases B-ART
line O
two O
of O
the O
walls B-ART
, O
a O
blackboard B-ART
covers O
the O
third O
and O
the O
entrance O
and O
filing O
cabinets B-ART
take O
up O
the O
last O
. O
In O
the O
center O
of O
the O
office O
sits O
the O
professor's O
desk B-ART
. O
Next O
to O
the O
desk B-ART
is O
a O
wastebasket B-ART
. O


You O
have O
never O
used O
an O
elevator B-ART
before O
and O
are O
now O
standing O
right O
next O
to O
one O
. O
On O
the O
wall B-ART
beside O
the O
elevator B-ART
is O
a O
narrow B-ART
slot I-ART
. O


This O
massive O
and O
ornately O
designed O
Royal B-ART
Palace I-ART
is O
truly O
impressive O
. O
It O
appears O
to O
be O
configured O
in O
an O
'L' O
shape O
, O
stretching O
along O
the O
north O
and O
west O
borders O
of O
the O
Plaza O
while O
guards B-ART
stand O
ready O
along O
the O
entire O
perimeter O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
outside O
the O
Pheebor B-ART
Public I-ART
Library I-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
on O
Center B-ART
Street I-ART
, O
which O
runs O
north O
and O
south O
. O
You O
see O
a O
Coffee B-ART
House I-ART
on O
the O
west O
side O
of O
the O
street B-ART
while O
a O
gap O
between O
some B-ART
buildings I-ART
leads O
back O
to O
the O
Plaza O
. O


Customers O
sit O
quietly O
at O
small O
round O
tables B-ART
sipping O
coffee B-ART
and O
reading O
the O
latest O
best O
sellers O
. O
In O
the O
corner O
, O
a O
folk B-ART
guitarist I-ART
softly O
strums O
a O
quiet O
melody O
while O
the O
proprietor B-ART
is O
busy O
behind O
the O
counter B-ART
grinding O
and O
blending O
coffee B-ART
beans O
. O


This O
is O
a O
corner O
junction O
where O
River O
Street O
and O
Center O
Street O
join O
. O
River O
Street O
continues O
toward O
the O
east O
, O
and O
Center O
Street O
leads O
south O
. O
Some O
high B-ART
rise I-ART
condominiums B-ART
occupy O
the O
corner O
on O
the O
north O
and O
west O
sides O
. O


Row O
upon O
row O
of O
bookcases B-ART
are O
reflected O
in O
the O
glistening O
tile O
floor O
that O
stretches O
endlessly O
before O
you O
. O


Judging O
by O
the O
dust B-ART
on O
the O
vanity B-ART
and O
the O
melted O
lamp B-ART
, O
I O
don't O
think O
this O
bedroom B-ART
has O
been O
used O
in O
a O
long O
time O
, O
except O
by O
yours O
truly O
. O
It's O
rather O
stately O
, O
though O
. O
I've O
never O
slept O
in O
a O
canopy B-ART
bed I-ART
before O
. O
Everything B-ART
looks O
antique O
and O
hand O
carved O
. O
There's O
Victorian O
wallpaper B-ART
on O
the O
walls B-ART
, O
and O
the O
floor O
is O
polished B-ART
wood I-ART
. O


The O
hallway O
is O
dark O
and O
quite O
narrow O
there's O
barely O
enough O
room O
for O
me O
to O
stretch O
out B-ART
my O
arms O
. O
There's O
this O
weird B-ART
painting I-ART
on O
the O
wall O
, O
too O
. O


Here's O
fun O
! O
This O
room O
with O
the O
high O
ceiling O
is O
clearly O
an O
abandoned O
kitchen B-ART
. O
I O
don't O
see O
any O
food O
anywhere O
, O
but O
with O
a O
wooden O
table B-ART
, O
a O
brick B-ART
oven I-ART
built O
into O
one O
of O
the O
walls O
, O
and O
a O
cabinet B-ART
on O
the O
opposite O
wall O
with O
a O
counter B-ART
on O
top O
, O
it's O
difficult O
to O
conclude O
anything O
other O
than O
kitchen B-ART
. O
What's O
especially O
great O
about O
this O
kitchen B-ART
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
is O
that O
an O
iron O
staircase B-ART
is O
spiraling O
right O
out O
of O
the O
floor O
and O
up O
to O
the O
second O
story O
. O
There's O
also O
a O
window B-ART
with O
a O
diamond B-ART
shaped O
panel O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
illuminating O
the O
table B-ART
and I-ART
chairs I-ART
. O
To O
the O
west O
there's O
a O
door B-ART
leading O
outside B-ART
. O


Here's O
hoping O
I O
don't O
have O
to O
use O
this O
bathroom B-ART
anytime O
soon O
. O
I O
think O
someone O
ran O
out B-ART
of O
Scrubbing O
Bubbles O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O
Streaks O
and O
lines O
on O
the O
ceramic O
tiled O
walls B-ART
are O
good O
evidence O
of O
futile O
efforts O
to O
clean O
the O
grime O
and O
mold O
off O
with O
a O
washcloth O
. O
. O
. O
many O
years O
ago O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
probably O
linoleum O
, O
but O
let's O
not O
think O
about O
the O
floor O
too O
much O
. O
There's O
also O
normal O
bathroom B-ART
stuff O
in O
here O
like O
a O
sink B-ART
, O
a O
shower B-ART
, O
a O
mirror B-ART
, O
etc O
. O


An O
overgrown O
garden O
surrounded O
by O
a O
high O
, O
whitewashed B-ART
wall B-ART
. O
Looking O
up O
to O
the O
gray O
sky B-ART
, O
I O
see O
that O
the O
wall B-ART
seems O
to O
block O
the O
mist O
somehow O
. O
The O
sky B-ART
is O
clear O
, O
albeit O
gray O
, O
directly O
above O
me O
. O
There's O
a O
sundial B-ART
that O
casts O
no O
shadow O
, O
and O
the O
hedges B-ART
need O
to O
be O
clipped O
badly O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
house B-ART
. O
To O
the O
north O
there's O
an O
interesting O
sort O
of O
shack B-ART
. O
It's O
built O
into O
the O
wall B-ART
and O
seems O
to O
slope O
underneath O
it O
. O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
boathouse B-ART
! O


I O
see O
a O
slave B-ART
driver I-ART
and O
a O
boat B-ART
here O
, O
and O
I O
ain't O
got O
much O
choice O
left O
. O


Late O
at O
night O
this O
subway B-ART
platform O
is O
eerily O
quiet O
. O
To O
the O
north O
a O
train B-ART
has O
just O
pulled O
up O
and O
opened O
its O
doors O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

There O
are O
nine O
other O
people O
in O
the O
car O
with O
you O
. O
One O
of O
them O
, O
a O
dark O
haired O
woman B-ART
is O
remarkably O
beautiful O
. O


Come O
now O
, O
as O
light O
thickens O
, O
and O
the O
crow O
makes O
wing O
to O
rookery O
wood O
. O
Tempests B-ART
rise O
as O
great O
bloody O
hands B-ART
, O
to O
tear O
down O
our O
safe O

homely O
lives O
. O
Come O
with O
me O
on O
dragon O

This O
cobbled B-ART
street O
slopes O
downwards O
towards O
the O

narrower O

close O

A O

A O
simple O

at O
the O

You O
hear O
the O
unmistakable O
sound O
of O
The O
Professor B-ART
close O
behind O
you O

he O
seems O
satisfied O
by O
your O

that O

A O

A O

up O

A O

up O

wrests O
the O

your O

replaces O

The O
jester B-ART
tells O
a O
bawdy O
joke O
with O
a O
punchline O
in O
Elizabethan O
English O
. O


It's O
early O
morning O
, O
and O
it's O
quite O
obvious O
to O
tell O
. O
Your O
wife O
, O
Jane B-ART
Doe I-ART
, O
is O
fixing O
lunches O
for O
your O
two B-ART
kids O
. O
To O
head O
out B-ART
, O
you O
should O
go O
east O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
small O
chamber O
, O
approximately O
three B-ART
feet O
wide O
and O
six B-ART
tall O
, O
allowing O
you O
barely O
any O
room O
. O
Oddly O
, O
the O
walls B-ART
are O
a O
bright O
blue O
color O
, O
while O
the O
ceiling B-ART
is O
a O
colorful O
shade O
of O
orange O
and O
the O
floor O
a O
sunny O
yellow O
. O


Nothing O
surrounds O
you O
. O
The O
virtual B-ART
space I-ART
is O
unbounded O
and O
absolutely O
blank O
, O
except O
for O
your O
new O
archetype B-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
somewhere O
in O
a O
vast B-ART
field I-ART
of I-ART
barley I-ART
. O
The O
barley B-ART
stretches O
as O
far O
as O
you O
can O
see O
in O
every O
direction O
under O
a O
hot B-ART
summer I-ART
sky I-ART
. O


The O
ice B-ART
of O
the O
Cocytean O
piedmont O
is O
pitted O
and O
rotten O
, O
riddled O
with O
moulins O
of O
befouled O
meltwater O
. O
For O
the O
most O
part O
the O
caves B-ART
are O
unstable O
, O
but O
they O
don't O
tend B-ART
to O
change O
too O
much O
over O
winter O
. O
This O
one O
is O
large O
enough O
to O
serve O
as O
temporary O
depot O
, O
but O
small O
and O
twisty O
enough O
to O
keep O
it O
hidden O
. O


Although O
the O
ideal O
crew O
of O
a O
'gin O
of O
this O
class O
is O
three B-ART
, O
the O
Quagga O
has O
been O
rigged O
to O
allow O
it O
to O
be O
crewed O
one O
handed O
, O
though O
you'd O
break O
your O
back O
jumping O
between O
helm B-ART
and I-ART
firebox I-ART
at O
anything O
faster O
than O
a O
trot O
. O
The O
cut O
down O
controls O
essentially O
just O
the O
gearshaft B-ART
and I-ART
helm I-ART
will O
not O
exactly O
allow O
you O
to O
fight O
any O
cavalry O
actions O
, O
but O
fortunately O
Hell O
is O
short O
on O
armour O
regiments O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
bedroom B-ART
. O
Everything B-ART
about O
this O
room O
seems O
normal O
on O
one O
level O
and O
yet O
oddly O
different O
on O
another O
. O
A O
quick O
scan O
around O
the O
room O
makes O
you O
ill O
at O
ease O
, O
as O
if O
you O
don't O
belong O
here O
. O
Or O
perhaps O
the O
room O
itself O
doesn't O
belong O
anywhere O
. O
A O
dresser B-ART
complete O
with O
a O
mirror B-ART
lies O
off O
to O
one O
side O
, O
against O
a O
white O
, O
featureless O
wall B-ART
. O
A O
door B-ART
is O
off O
to O
the O
west O
while O
to O
the O
south O
, O
through O
a O
doorway B-ART
, O
you O
can O
see O
what O
must O
be O
a O
small O
bathroom O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
living B-ART
room I-ART
. O
The O
room B-ART
is O
sparsely O
furnished O
in O
modern O
, O
chrome O
and O
black O
acrylic B-ART
furniture I-ART
. O
On O
one O
of O
the O
walls B-ART
is O
a O
curtain B-ART
with O
an O
oddly O
familiar O
patterned B-ART
fabric B-ART
draped O
from O
floor O
to O
ceiling B-ART
. O
Open O
doorways B-ART
lead O
off O
to O
the O
west O
and O
south O
, O
while O
a O
door B-ART
lies O
off O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You're O
in O
the O
dining B-ART
room I-ART
, O
complete O
with O
a O
dining B-ART
room I-ART
table I-ART
and I-ART
chairs I-ART
. O
There O
are O
three O
doorways B-ART
here O
one O
to O
the O
north O
, O
one O
to O
the O
west O
and O
another O
to O
the O
east O

You're O
standing O
in O
the O
kitchen B-ART
of O
the O
apartment O
with O
a O
doorway O
to O
the O
east O
. O
Cabinets B-ART
line O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
broken O
by O
a O
large O
refrigerator B-ART
beside O
a O
range B-ART
. O
The O
place O
looks O
sort O
of O
like O
your O
own O
apartment O
, O
but O
the O
floor O
is O
a O
wild O
circular O
pattern O
and O
the O
ceiling B-ART
is O
a O
light O
blue O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
entry B-ART
way O
to O
an O
apartment B-ART
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
white O
, O
the O
floor O
a O
neutral O
beige O
. O
To O
the O
west O
lies O
a O
humming O
and O
buzzing O
corridor O
which O
dissolves O
into O
a O
thick O
, O
foggy O
mist O
. O
Off O
to O
the O
east O
is O
the O
living O
room O
. O


A O
white O
mist B-ART
envelops O
you O
in O
mid O
stride O
. O
The O
floor O
beneath O
you O
drops O
away O
and O
you O
feel O
as O
though O
you O
are O
falling O
through O
space O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
laboratory B-ART
, O
buried O
deep O
within O
the O
Research O
Zone O
. O
Parts O
of O
the O
lab B-ART
seem O
oddly O
familiar O
, O
though O
most O
of O
it O
looks O
different O
from O
what O
you O
remember O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
made O
of O
a O
strange O
translucent O
material O
which O
seem O
to O
generate O
their O
own O
light O
from O
within O
. O
A O
black B-ART
, O
acrylic O
shell B-ART
which O
occupies O
the O

You O

To O
the O

You O
stand O
before O
a O
gleaming O
pyramid B-ART

rises O
up O

out O
the O

As O
you O

The O

the O

begin O

You O
know O
it's O
a O

a O
town O
to O
the O
east O
. O


A O
busy O
port O
street O
bustling O
with O
people O
who O
look O
as O
worn O
out B-ART
as O
the O
cobblestones O
. O
To O
the O
north O
is O
a O
fishmonger O
, O
to O
the O
south O
a O
post O
office O
. O
The O
docks O
are O
back B-ART
west O
. O
Further O
down O
the O
street O
, O
to O
the O
northeast O
is O
a O
pub O
, O
and O
a O
travel O
agent's O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


Like O
your O
idea O
of O
a O
traditional O
English O
pub O
, O
if O
you O
had O
incredibly O
low O
standards O
. O
It's O
got O
more O
than O
its O
fair O
share O
of O
damage O
broken O
stools B-ART
, O
burned O
table O
tops B-ART
, O
and O
what O
looks O
to O
be O
a O
large O
blood B-ART
stain I-ART
on O
the O
floor O
right B-ART
in O
front O
of O
the O
bathroom B-ART
. O


Each O
shop O
on O
this O
street O
seems O
to O
be O
smaller O
than O
the O
last O
, O
and O
the O
travel B-ART
agency O
is O
no O
exception O
, O
being O
nothing O
but O
a O
desk B-ART
and O
a O
rack B-ART
of I-ART
travel I-ART
brochures I-ART
. O


A O
tiny O
post O
office O
containing O
nothing O
but O
a O
wall O
of O
post O
office O
boxes B-ART
and O
a O
small O
counter O
. O
You O
wonder O
when O
the O
last O
time O
it O
was O
cleaned O
; O
every O
surface O
is O
coated O
in O
sea B-ART
salt I-ART
, I-ART
cobwebs I-ART
, O
or O
both B-ART
. O


A O
tiny O
fishmonger's B-ART
shop O
sits O
just O
off O
the O
main O
dock O
street O
. O
The O
blackboard B-ART
listing O
today's O
prices B-ART
has O
been O
erased O
so O
many O
times O
you O
can O
hardly O
read O
it O
. O


The O
room O
has O
a O
very O
dark O
feeling O
too O
it O
. O
Everything B-ART
in O
here O
is O
grey O
and O
old O
. O
There O
is O
a O
long O
counter B-ART
top I-ART
with O
a O
sink B-ART
that O
has O
a O
cupboard B-ART
underneath O
it O
. O
At O
the O
far O
end O
of O
the O
counter B-ART
is O
a O
washing B-ART
machine I-ART
and O
beside O
it O
, O
a O
filing B-ART
cabinet I-ART
. O
High O
on O
the O
back O
wall O
is O
a O
fusebox B-ART
. O
A O
big B-ART
rusty I-ART
door I-ART
blocks O
your O
only O
escape O
to O
the O
west O
. O


This O
is O
the O
north O
side O
of O
the O
room O
. O
A O
heavy B-ART
steel I-ART
door I-ART
presumably O
the O
exit O
is O
set O
into O
the O
north O
wall B-ART
, O
and O
numerous O
heavy B-ART
wooden I-ART
boards I-ART
have O
been O
nailed O
across O
it O
. O
Seems O
like O
someone O
didn't O
want O
you O
leaving O
this O
place O
. O


This O
is O
the O
west O
side O
of O
the O
room O
. O
A O
plain B-ART
white I-ART
door I-ART
which O
is O
currently O
closed O
leads O
west O
. O
Next O
to O
the O
door B-ART
, O
a O
red B-ART
, I-ART
glass I-ART
fronted I-ART
box B-ART
is O
mounted O
on O
the O
wall B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
south O
side O
of O
the O
room O
. O
An O
uncomfortable O
looking O
cot B-ART
is O
pushed O
up O
against O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
underneath O
a O
small B-ART
barred I-ART
window B-ART
. O


My O
plywood O
furnishings O
are O
completely O
ruined O
and O
more O
importantly O
, O
the O
poor O
chap B-ART
can O
be O
seen O
, O
trapped O
beneath O
a O
beam B-ART
. O


The O
room O
is O
dusty O
and O
dank O
, O
a O
musty O
smell O
prevails O
throughout O
the O
room O
. O
It O
seems O
as O
though O
it O
has O
been O
a O
very O
long O
time O
since O
anyone O
entered O
this O
room O
. O
Some O
rotted B-ART
wood I-ART
lies O
along O
the O
walls O
, O
possibly O
the O
remains O
of O
a O
few O
bookshelves B-ART


The O
chief O
feature O
of O
this O
area O
is O
that O
you O
don't O
recognize O
it O
and O
have O
no O
idea O
where O
you O
are O
. O
A O
door B-ART
is O
west O
, O
and O
you O
can O
go O
east O
. O


You O
can O
go O
west O
, O
and O
a O
door B-ART
is O
east O
. O


Wary O
also O
very O
hot O
. O
She B-ART
likes O
sunburn O
, O
you O
do O
not O
. O
Autumn's O
west O
and O
Spring O
is O
east O
. O


Air O
is O
chilly O
, O
she B-ART
don't O
like O
. O
She B-ART
wants O
to O
sleep O
, O
you'd O
rather O
hike O
. O
Winter's O
west O
and O
Summer's O
east O
. O


Short O
of O
breath O
and O
long O
on O
sneezes O
, O
itchy O
eyes O
and O
wimpering O
wheezes O
. O
She B-ART
would O
like O
to O
roll O
in O
hay O
. O
Summer's O
west O
, O
and O
Winter's O
east O
. O


The O
garden B-ART
is O
naturally O
fairly O
empty O
at O
this O
time O
of O
the O
year O
, O
although O
the O
variegated B-ART
ivy B-ART
among O
the O
shrubbery B-ART
gives O
it O
a O
little B-ART
colour O
. O
To O
the O
right B-ART
is O
a O
wooden B-ART
fence I-ART
too O
high B-ART
to O
see O
over B-ART
. O
To O
the O
left B-ART
, I-ART
beyond I-ART
a O
row O
of O
low B-ART
posts I-ART
, O
is O
your O
neighbour's B-ART
garden B-ART
, I-ART
brightened I-ART
, O
unlike O
yours O
, O
by O
a O
red B-ART
camellia I-ART
. O
The O
garden B-ART
path I-ART
runs O
the O
ten O
yards B-ART
between O
the O
conservatory B-ART
and O
the O
rear B-ART
gate I-ART
. O


It O
has O
snowed B-ART
! O
It's O
less O
than O
half O
an O
inch O
, O
over B-ART
the O
lawn B-ART
and O
it's O
melting O
on O
the O
path B-ART
. O
The O
roof B-ART
of O
the O
shed B-ART
is O
white B-ART
. O
You O
can O
see O
the O
beds B-ART
to O
the O
left B-ART
of O
the O
lawn B-ART
, O
mostly O
covered B-ART
, O
and O
the O
little B-ART
tree I-ART
standing O
up O
from O
the O
hard B-ART
white I-ART
area I-ART
to O
the O
right B-ART
. O


There O
seem O
to O
be O
lots B-ART
of I-ART
things I-ART
coming O
up O
in O
the O
long B-ART
border I-ART
on O
your O
left B-ART
, O
which O
is O
next B-ART
to O
the O
neighbour's B-ART
fence B-ART
. O
You O
can O
also O
see O
the O
lawn B-ART
, O
the O
bricked B-ART
area B-ART
you O
could O
call O
a O
terrace B-ART
, O
the O
path B-ART
separating O
the O
two B-ART
and O
the O
shed B-ART
. O


From O
here O
you O
have O
a O
view O
of O
your O
neighbours' B-ART
garden B-ART
on O
your O
left B-ART
and O
part O
of O
the O
street B-ART
beyond I-ART
, O
and O
of O
your O
garden B-ART
as O
far O
as O
the O
shed B-ART
. O
That O
area B-ART
, O
measuring O
less O
than O
twenty O
feet O
by O
forty O
, O
includes O
the O
two B-ART
flower I-ART
beds I-ART
, O
the O
lawn B-ART
, O
the O
path B-ART
, O
the O
shack B-ART
on O
the O
back B-ART
and O
the O
terrace B-ART
. O
Some O
bits B-ART
of I-ART
litter I-ART
seem O
to O
have O
come O
in O
somehow O
. O


The O
sun B-ART
is O
approaching O
its O
mid O
day B-ART
peak O
, O
and O
saturating O
the O
garden B-ART
with O
colour O
. O
The O
dark O
figure O
of O
the O
shed B-ART
at O
the O
end O
, O
with O
the O
garden B-ART
next I-ART
door I-ART
and O
the O
street B-ART
visible O
to O
the O
left B-ART
, O
the O
bright B-ART
green I-ART
lawn I-ART
and O
all O
the O
plants B-ART
in O
the O
flower B-ART
beds I-ART
, O
and O
even O
the O
reddish B-ART
brick B-ART
area I-ART
, O
all O
seem O
unusually O
vivid O
. O


A O
very O
bright B-ART
day I-ART
, O
adding O
extra O
colour O
to O
all O
you O
can O
see O
; O
from O
the O
northern O
fence B-ART
which O
wastes B-ART
the O
sun B-ART
it O
receives O
, O
left B-ART
to O
the O
brick B-ART
area I-ART
, O
the O
path B-ART
, O
the O
shed B-ART
, O
the O
lawn B-ART
, I-ART
herb I-ART
bed I-ART
and I-ART
long I-ART
border I-ART
, O
and O
a O
view O
of O
your O
neighbours' B-ART
garden B-ART
and O
part O
of O
the O
street B-ART
beyond I-ART
, O
around O
to O
your O
house B-ART
and I-ART
conservatory I-ART
. O


The O
early O
afternoon B-ART
sun I-ART
beats O
against O
the O
high B-ART
wooden I-ART
fence I-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
beyond B-ART
a O
low B-ART
fence I-ART
, O
is O
your O
neighbour's B-ART
garden B-ART
, O
full O
of O
hanging B-ART
baskets I-ART
and I-ART
honeysuckle I-ART
. O
The O
garden B-ART
path I-ART
runs O
the O
ten O
yards B-ART
between O
the O
conservatory B-ART
and O
the O
rear B-ART
gate I-ART

separating O
the O

flower I-ART
beds I-ART
to O
the O
left B-ART
and O
the O
terrace B-ART
to O
the O
right B-ART
. O


This O
room O
is O
full O
of O
silence O
. O
Freshly O
disturbed O
dust B-ART
hangs O
upon O
the O
air O
. O
There O
are O
patterns B-ART
of I-ART
pressure I-ART
upon O
the O
carpet B-ART
, O
suggesting O
there O
are O
spaces B-ART
where O
once O
there O
weren't O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
bare O
, O
but O
for O
the O
occasional O
pictureless O
hook B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
wardrobe B-ART
here O
, O
a O
chest B-ART
of I-ART
drawers I-ART
and O
a O
skeleton B-ART
of I-ART
shelves I-ART
against O
the O
far O
wall O
. O


Winter O
light O
lies O
in O
anaemic O
strips O
upon O
the O
floor O
from O
where O
it O
has O
fallen O
through O
the O
glass O
panels B-ART
in O
the O
front O
door B-ART
. O
There O
is O
an O
awful B-ART
painting I-ART
hanging O
on O
the O
wall O
. O
The O
murmuring O
voices O
are O
more O
of O
a O
babble O
now O
; O
too O
many O
over O
lapping O
conversations O
create O
an O
alien O
, O
baboonish O
gibberish O
. O


The O
extensive O
living O
dining O
area O
was O
one O
of O
the O
features O
that O
drew O
you O
all O
to O
this O
house O
when O
you O
were O
looking O
for O
places O
to O
rent O
. O
That O
and O
despite O
the O
fact O
none O
of O
you O
have O
been O
able O
to O
bring O
yourself B-ART
to O
do O
anything O
as O
prosaic O
as O
cleaning O
for O
days O
the O
fact O
it's O
not O
an O
abject O
shit O
hole O
like O
most O
of O
the O
places O
on O
offer O
when O
you O
were O
doing O
the O
rounds O
. O


The O
kitchen O
is O
surprisingly O
spacious O
for O
a O
rented O
house O
. O
It O
has O
faux O
granite O
counter B-ART
tops O
and O
matching O
tiling B-ART
, O
and O
fitted O
cupboards B-ART
in O
shades O
of O
coffee O
and O
cream O
. O


The O
back O
garden O
is O
really O
little O
more O
than O
a O
lawn B-ART
gone O
wild O
and O
a O
weedy O
patio B-ART
. O
The O
sky B-ART
is O
a O
cool O
grey O
curtain O
backlit O
by O
the O
weak O
sun B-ART
. O
The O
chill O
air O
bites O
at O
your O
skin O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
by O
your O
bed B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
room O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
room O
used O
for O
cooking O
and O
food O
preparation O
. O
Something O
smells O
good O
coming O
from O
the O
stove B-ART
. O


The O
corridor O
is O
lined O
with O
lights O
against O
the O
wall O
. O
The O
elevator B-ART
door I-ART
is O
closed O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
small B-ART
bedroom I-ART
. O
Along O
the O
walls B-ART
are O
various O
paintings B-ART
. O
Resting O
on O
the O
thick B-ART
carpet I-ART
is O
a O
nightstand B-ART
. O
A O
strip B-ART
of I-ART
wallpaper I-ART
near O
the O
ceiling B-ART
adds O
a O
dark O
red O
accent O
to O
the O
otherwise O
white O
bedroom B-ART
. O
In O
the O
north O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
room O
is O
a O
large B-ART
window I-ART
. O
A O
mirror B-ART
hangs O
by O
the O
window B-ART
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
a O
door B-ART
that O
leads O
to O
a O
closet B-ART
of O
some O
sort O
. O
Visibility O
through O
the O
doorway B-ART
to O
the O
south O
is O
blocked O
by O
strings B-ART
of I-ART
beads I-ART
hanging O
down O
, O
but O
it O
probably O
leads O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
house O
. O


This O
imposing O
room O
used O
to O
underline O
the O
theater's O
former O
glory O
, O
heaps O
of O
equipment O
lying O
all O
over O
the O
place O
in O
demonstratively O
unkempt O
heaps O
. O
As O
times O
grew O
harder O
, O
however O
, O
it O
has O
been O
stripped O
of O
its O
former O
abundance O
now O
it O
only O
possesses O
a O
chair B-ART
, O
a O
wall B-ART
safe I-ART
and O
the O
mainframe B-ART
set O
up O
the O
last O
night O
. O


This O
is O
the O
cultural O
center O
of O
apartment O
F209 O
. O
Its O
true O
symbolic O
magnificence O
is O
once O
again O
belied O
by O
its O
current O
squalid O
nature O
. O
You O
wonder O
for O
a O
while O
how O
anyone O
could O
actually O
live O
in O
a O
place O
like O
this O
, O
until O
you O
remember O
that O
you O
pay O
the O
rent O
here O
. O
The O
endless O
white O
of O
the O
undecorated O
walls B-ART
is O
interrupted O
only O
by O
a O
hallway O
to O
the O
south O
, O
the O
kitchen O
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
the O
front O
door B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


A O
formless O
void O
. O
Empty O
. O
Dull O
. O
There O
appears O
to O
be O
no O
way O
out B-ART
. O
Still O
, O
better O
than O
Detroit O
. O


This O
small O
alley O
is O
being O
basically O
ignored O
by O
the O
large O
parade O
to O
the O
west O
. O
A O
carnival O
of O
some O
kind O
stretches O
out B-ART
to O
the O
east O
. O


You're O
standing O
west O
of O
a O
small O
, O
eldritch O
looking O
white O
house O
purporting O
to O
be O
a O
bakery B-ART
. O
A O
huge O
parade O
of O
partygoers O
continues O
to O
stream O
by O
to O
the O
west O
, O
while O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
bakery B-ART
yawns O
open O
to O
the O
east O
. O


Oh O
, O
let's O
see O
. O
. O
it's O
bad O
up O
here O
. O
There's O
the O
console B-ART
, O
with O
the O
computer B-ART
screen I-ART
on O
. O
The O
engineer O

McThwaite B-ART

Oh O

The O

This O
is O
the O
centre O
of O
a O
small O
village O
made O
of O
concrete O
. O
The O
square O
extends O
to O
the O
east O
where O
you O
can O
make O
out B-ART
some O
buildings O
. O
Surprisingly O
, O
someone O
seems O
to O
have O
planted O
an O
oak B-ART
tree I-ART
here O
. O


This O
is O
Toadstool O
Street O
, O
a O
long O
east O
west O
road O
which O
connects O
the O
village O
square O
with O
the O
rest O

Many O
village O
squares O
are O
, O
of O
course O
, O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
any O
village O
, O
but O
the O
villages O
in O
Fairyland O
are O
laid O
out B-ART
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
the O
square O
is O
usually O
on O
the O
western O
side O
of O
the O
town O

To O
the O
north O
is O
a O
pub O

The O
inn O
, O
a O
welcoming O
sight O
for O
travellers O
, O
is O
a O
cozy O
one O
indeed O
. O
It O
is O
here O
where O
you O
can O
get O
a O
bed O
for O
the O
night O
upstairs O

a O
good O
hot O

Outside O
you O
can O
hear O
the O

the O
weak O
walls O
of O
the O

The O
only O
light O
in O
the O

They O
say O
that O

where O
you O
hang O
your O
hat B-ART

This O
is O
the O
place O
you O
call O
home O
, O
but O
if O
you O
let O
go O
of O
your O
hat B-ART
off O
it'd O
probably O
try O
to O
escape O
. O
Your O
one O
room O
office B-ART
, O
leased O
from O

a O

has O
heat O

you O
open O
the O

and O
hot O

The O
latter O
occasionally O
emit O
squeals O

opportunity O

They O
also O
provide O
the O
random O
excremental O
smells O

at O

you O
hope O
so O
. O
It's O
not O
all O
bad O

you O
tend B-ART
to O
collect O
gizmos B-ART
that O
you O
try O

up O
in O
your O
spare O
time O

What's O
more O
, O
when O
the O
phone B-ART
rings O
, O
you O
sometimes O
get O
a O
case O

and O
have O
a O
good O
reason O
to O
leave O

If O
you O
were O

it'd O
be O

Your O

Two B-ART

There's O
sure O
to O
be O
bits O
of O
your O
television B-ART
here O
Ralph B-ART
couldn't O
have O
thrown O
it O
far O
but O
it O
blends O
in O
with O
the O

Through O
the O
iron B-ART
balconies I-ART

a O
small O
bit O
of O
light O
filters O
into O
the O
dank O

is O
blocked O
off O

but O
the O
west O
end O
opens O

This O
is O
a O
rather O
small O
office B-ART
, O
as O
befits O
your O
assistant O
assistant O
managerial O
position O
. O
The O
chief O
features O
are O
the O
desk B-ART
which O
is O
too O
small O
for O
good O
use O
, O
yet O
just O
large O
enough O
to O
take O
up O
too O
much O
space O
, O
and O
the O
window B-ART
which O
you O
can O
never O
quite O
get O
to O
stay O
closed O
. O
The O
open B-ART
door I-ART
leads O
west O
to O
the O
hallway O

Not O
much O
to O
say O

really O
. O
Your O
office B-ART
is O
to O
the O
east O
and O
the O
stairs O
are O
to O
the O
south O
. O
There O
is O
a O
closet O
to O
the O
north O

The O
icy O
salt O
water O
stings O
your O
nostrils O
as O
you O
thrash O
about O
madly O
. O
Unless O
you O
get O
out B-ART
of O
here O
quick O
, O
you've O
got O
seconds O
to O
live O
. O


The O
docks B-ART
are O
deserted O
at O
this O
time O

night O

A O
chill O

carries O
the O
salty O
air O
from O
the O

the O
west O

To O
the O

a O

The O
alley O
dead O

here O
in O
a O
corrugated B-ART
metal B-ART

This O
is O
very O
like O
the O
room B-ART
you O
were O
assigned O
for O
this O
year's O
exam O
season O
. O
There O
are O
dozens O
of O
them O
in O
the O
Administration O
Centre's O
residential O
block O
, O
all O
more O
or O
less O
identical O
. O
But O
it O
cannot O
be O
your O
room B-ART
, O
because O
all O
of O
your O
stuff O
is O
gone O
, O
and O
the O
room B-ART
looks O
like O
it O
did O
when O
you O
first O
moved O
in O
. O
It's O
clean O
, O
tidy O
, O
and O
almost O
completely O
empty O
, O
just O
with O
basic O
furnishings O
desk B-ART

There's O
a O
window B-ART
in O
the O
north O
wall B-ART

a O
door B-ART
leads O
south O
. O


This O
is O
the O
main O
entrance B-ART
to O
the O
sprawling O
Administration O
Centre O
. O
Large B-ART
doors I-ART
to O
the O
south O
would O
lead O
to O
the O
driveway B-ART
and O
surrounding O
parkland O
, O
but O
you O
cannot O
see O
anything O
through O
the O
windows B-ART
in O
the O
south O
wall B-ART
. O
A O
grand B-ART
staircase I-ART
leads O
upwards O
. O
Doors B-ART
lead O
east O
and O
west O
to O
the O
wings B-ART
of O
the O
main O
building O
, O
while O
a O
smaller O
exit O
leads O
north O
to O
the O
quadrangle B-ART

There O
is O
a O
green B-ART
door I-ART
in O
the O
northwest O
corner O
of O
the O

There's O
a O
mural B-ART

western O
wall B-ART

and O
a O
portrait B-ART

a O
mirror B-ART
on O
the O
eastern O

The O
quadrangle B-ART
is O
completely O
surrounded O
by O
Administration B-ART
Centre B-ART
buildings I-ART
. O
It's O
a O
large O
, O
square O
outdoor B-ART
space O
with O
well O
tended B-ART
lawns B-ART
and I-ART
flowerbeds I-ART
and I-ART
paths I-ART
leading O
in O
all O
directions O

The O
place O
is O
unnervingly O
quiet O
. O
Though O
the O
buildings B-ART
, I-ART
paths I-ART

gardens I-ART
are O
well O
lit O
, O
the O
sky B-ART
is O
completely O
black B-ART

The O
first B-ART
floor O
landing B-ART
forms O
a O
mezzanine B-ART
here O
, O
overlooking O
the O
lobby B-ART
below I-ART

It's O
a O
sort O
of O
waiting B-ART
room I-ART
, O
placed O
right O
outside B-ART
the O
Central B-ART
Administrator's I-ART
office B-ART
, O
which O
is O
through O
the O
double B-ART
doors I-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O
A O
corridor B-ART
leads O
east O
, O
and O
a O
grand B-ART
staircase I-ART
leads O
down O
. O
Like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
building O
, O
the O
mezzanine B-ART
is O
deserted O
, O
but O
if O
anyone O
was O
waiting B-ART
here O
, O
they O
would O
be O
able O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
sofa B-ART
and O
read O
the O
papers B-ART
on O
the O
coffee B-ART
table I-ART

Or O
they O
might O
look O
at O
the O
rather O
Administratively B-ART
themed B-ART
artwork I-ART
on O
the O
walls B-ART
. O


The O
corridor B-ART
turns O
a O
corner B-ART
here O
, O
continuing O
to O
the O
north O
and O
west O
. O
The O
Security B-ART
Administrator's I-ART
office B-ART
is O
through O
a O
door B-ART
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
to O
the O
south O
, O
a O
short O
staircase B-ART
leads O
downwards O
to O
a O
darkened O
room B-ART

This O
is O
the O
Administration O
Centre's O
museum B-ART
. O
It's O
a O
vast O
hall B-ART
, O
stretching O
far O
away O
to O
the O
north O

east O
. O
It O
is O
currently O
closed O
and O
in O
darkness B-ART

A O
red B-ART
rope I-ART
blocks O
passage O
to O
the O
north O

. O
Light B-ART
is O
coming O
from O
the O
corridor B-ART
to O
the O
south O
and O
faintly O
from O
a O
blank O
video B-ART
screen I-ART
just O
beyond O
the O
rope B-ART
. O
Exhibition B-ART
displays B-ART
fill O
the O
room B-ART
, O
most O
too O
far O
away O
into O
the O
dark B-ART
to O
be O
readable O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
cavernous B-ART
room I-ART
built O
on O
the O
same O
vast O
scale O
as O
a O
concert O
hall O
. O
It O
cannot O
possibly O
fit O
within O
the O
buildings O
of O
the O
Administration O
Centre B-ART
the O
normal O
rules O
of O
geometry B-ART
have O
clearly O
been O
bent O
here O
. O
You O
are O
standing O
in O
an O
observation B-ART
gallery B-ART
far O
above B-ART
the O
floor O
, O
which O
is O
filled O
with O
concentric O
circles O
of O
workstation B-ART
desks B-ART
. O
All O
face O
the O
centre B-ART
of O
the O
room B-ART
, O
where O
another O
circular B-ART
desk I-ART
is O
placed O
on O
a O
raised B-ART
platform I-ART
. O
Above B-ART
all O
of O
this O
, O
a O
huge O
three B-ART
dimensional O
globe B-ART
hangs O
in O
empty O
space O
. O
The O
dim O
lighting B-ART
in O
the O
room B-ART
comes O
mainly O
from O
the O
planet B-ART
, O
which O
glows O
with O
an O
internal O
light B-ART
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
stairs B-ART
lead O
up O
to O
the O
landing B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
bare O
, O
sterile O
room O
with O
a O
fridge B-ART
at O
work O
. O


An O
army B-ART
of O
cublicles O
are O
here O
, O
poised O
to O
overrun O
the O
world O
! O
The O
kitchen O
is O
north O
and O
the O
elevator O
is O
northeast O
. O


Buttons O
numbered O
one O
to O
three B-ART
on O
embedded O
in O
the O
wall B-ART
. O


People O
walk O
up O
and O
down O
this O
ribbon B-ART
of I-ART
old I-ART
brick I-ART
buildings I-ART
, O
alternately O
holding O
hands O
and O
giving O
each B-ART
other O
the O
finger B-ART
. O
Since O
you're O
on O
vacation O
, O
you O
try O
to O
remain O
patient O
long O
enough O
to O
take O
in O
the O
sights B-ART
; O
but O
since O
these O
are O
mostly O
made O
up O
of O
the O
immense B-ART
hotel I-ART
to O
the O
south O
, O
inside O
which O
is O
the O
convention O
, O
you O
find O
this O
difficult O
. O
Alleys B-ART
open O
to O
the O
southeast O
and O
southwest O
, O
and O
a O
nearby O
manhole B-ART
gapes O
from O
within O
caution B-ART
signs I-ART
. O
Amazingly O
, O
given O
their O
various O
apparent O
conditions B-ART
, O
the O
passersby B-ART
seem O
to O
be O
heeding O
this O
advice B-ART
enough O
to O
avoid O
actually O
falling O
in O
, O
anyway O
. O


On O
the O
bumper B-ART
of O
a O
car B-ART
parked I-ART
nearby O
is O
a O
sticker B-ART
that O
reads O
Atari O
Age O
. O


The O
pavement B-ART
will O
take O
you O
southeast O
from O
here O
, O
if O
you O
let O
it O
. O
The O
hotel B-ART
rises O
to O
your O
east O
, O
and O
returning O
northeast O
will O
take O
you O
back O
to O
the O
boulevard B-ART
. O


You O
face O
the O
entrance B-ART
to O
a O
towering B-ART
structure I-ART
with O
more O
glass B-ART
than O
bricks B-ART
but O
a O
remarkable O
insurance O
plan O
. O
You O
can O
enter O
to O
the O
south O
, O
or O
walk O
around O
the O
building B-ART
to O
the O
east O
or O
west O
. O
The O
boulevard B-ART
annoys O
from O
the O
north O
. O


The O
carpet B-ART
and I-ART
chandeliers I-ART
are O
probably O
supposed O
to O
be O
fancy B-ART
, O
but O
they O
arrive O
at O
ugly B-ART
long O
before O
that O
. O
A O
double B-ART
doorway I-ART
of I-ART
polished I-ART
oak I-ART
helpfully I-ART
breaks O
up O
the O
sadistically B-ART
floral B-ART
paper I-ART
on O
the O
eastern B-ART
wall I-ART
, O
while O
carrot B-ART
colored I-ART
stairs B-ART
, O
not O
so O
much O
winding B-ART
as O
actually O
twisting B-ART
, O
lead O
upward O
. O
You O
can O
exit B-ART
the O
hotel O
to O
the O
north O
. O


This O
is O
a O
narrow B-ART
area I-ART
to O
the O
rear B-ART
of O
the O
building B-ART
. O
A O
steel B-ART
crowbar I-ART
leans O
against O
the O
wall B-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
alleys I-ART
lead O
northeast O
and O
northwest O
. O


A O
nearby O
parked B-ART
car I-ART
wears O
an O
OC O
GS O
bumper B-ART
sticker I-ART

One O
particular B-ART
guy B-ART
stands O
out B-ART
, O
since O
he's O
not O
looking O
at O
any O
of O
the O
products B-ART
. O
He's O
just O
looking O
dejected B-ART
. O


You O
find O
yourself O
in O
an O
overflow B-ART
conduit I-ART
large O
enough O
to O
walk O
through O
, O
but O
not O
agreeably O
fragrant B-ART
enough O
to O
stand O
still O
in O
. O
It's O
blessedly B-ART
dry I-ART
, O
and O
a O
mild B-ART
draft I-ART
offers O
an O
even O
wider O
selection O
of O
intriguing B-ART
smells B-ART
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
A O
bend B-ART
in O
the O
tunnel B-ART
sends O
it O
off O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O


You're O
standing O
in O
a O
dry B-ART
but O
still O
unpleasant B-ART
box B-ART
of I-ART
concrete I-ART
beneath O
the O
manhole B-ART
, O
which O
is O
still O
within O
reach O
. O
To O
the O
southeast O
and O
southwest O
are O
troublingly B-ART
pipe B-ART
sha O
ped O
openings B-ART
. O
There's O
a O
thin B-ART
safety I-ART
cable I-ART
here O
. O


You O
might O
say O
it's O
a O
great O
natural O
resource O
depending O
on O
what O
you're O
after O
, O
but O
the O
stench O
is O
unbelievable O
, O
and O
you O
can't O
quite O
bring O
yourself O
to O
imagine O
what O
lurks O
in O
the O
clumps O
of O
mud O
besides O
mud O
. O
Concrete O
tunnels O
lead O
northeast O
and O
northwest O
into O
the O
bank O
. O
There O
is O
, O
appropriately O
enough O
, O
a O
Swordquest B-ART
Earthworld B-ART
cartridge B-ART
here O
. O


The O
birds B-ART
sing O
to O
you O
, O
the O
wind O
whips O
your O
hair O
, O
and O
the O
dirt O
would O
feel O
good O
between O
your O
toes O
if O
this O
adventure O
were O
complex O
enough O
to O
let O
you O
remove O
your O
shoes O
. O
Here O
are O
found O
all O
the O
typical O
qualities O
the O
sparkling B-ART
foam I-ART
, O
the O
glossy B-ART
pebbles I-ART
, O
the O
balls O
of O
flushed O
toilet O
paper O
. O


For O
some O
reason O
, O
you're O
navigating O
a O
concrete B-ART
overflow I-ART
tunnel I-ART
, O
complete O
with O
accompanying O
scents B-ART
. O
It's O
mercifully O
dry B-ART
at O
the O
moment O
, O
and O
you O
even O
feel O
a O
slight B-ART
breeze I-ART
from O
the O
southeast O
albeit O
not O
the O
familiar O
stimulating O
kind O
. O
Other O
openings B-ART
lead O
south O
and O
northeast O
. O


The O
ugly B-ART
carpeting I-ART
persists O
as O
this O
plush B-ART
corridor I-ART
briefly O
interrupts O
the O
stairs B-ART
, O
which O
lead O
up O
and O
down O
. O
There O
are O
northern B-ART
and I-ART
southern I-ART
doors I-ART
, I-ART
each I-ART
with O
a O
device B-ART
mounted I-ART
next O
to O
its O
handle B-ART
. O
There's O
a O
crumpled B-ART
soda I-ART
can O
here O
. O


Clutter O
and O
mess O
spread O
their O
way O
across O
the O
floor O
of O
your O
smallish O
room O
in O
Wall O
House O
, O
just O
west O
of O
the O
main O
campus B-ART
. O
A O
door B-ART
leads O
south O
to O
the O
hall O
, O
another O
west O
to O
the O
closet O
. O
Windows O
face O
east O

north O

Your O
desk B-ART
sits O
against O
one O
wall O
, O
next O
to O
the O
north O
window O
. O


Your O
few O
clothes B-ART
hang O
here O
dejectedly O
in O
this O
walk O
in O
closet O
, O
your O
room's O
only O
luxury O
. O
A O
bare O
lightbulb O
on O
the O
ceiling B-ART
provides O
light O
. O


The O
peeling O
paint O
on O
the O
walls O
creates O
a O
elegant O
counterpoint O
to O
the O
stained O
greenish B-ART
carpet B-ART
. O
Stairs O
lead O
down O
, O
and O
your O
room O
is O
north O
. O


The O
front O
door B-ART
leads O
you O
east O
and O
outside O
, O
while O
stairs O
go O
up O
and O
down O
. O


The O
very O
first O
thing B-ART
you O
notice O
about O
this O
place O
is O
the O
exits O
four O
of O
them O
. O
North O
, O
south O
, O
east O
, O
and O
west O
. O
The O
north O
one O
has O
a O
door B-ART
in O
it O
, O
though O
. O


Against O
the O
rough O
north O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
cavern O
lies O
a O
moon O
shaped O
landing B-ART
of O
white O
stone B-ART
, O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
shallow B-ART
steps I-ART
down O
to O
the O
glass B-ART
black O
surface O
of O
the O
lake B-ART
. O
A O
Moorish B-ART
archway I-ART
leads O
away O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
remember O
this O
place O
. O
The O
animals B-ART
, O
trapped O
in O
their O
cages B-ART
and O
motionless O
presumably O
stuffed O
. O
In O
one O
cage O
is O
an O
elephant B-ART
, O
so O
short O
that O
he O
reaches O
only O
to O
your O
knee O
; O
you O
easily O
could O
lift O
him B-ART
under O
one O
arm O
and O
carry O
him B-ART
away O
. O
In O
another O
cage O
, O
a O
giant B-ART
mouse I-ART
lies O
, O
curled O
as O
though O
slumbering O
. O


A O
whole O
strange O
grove O
of O
strange O
trees B-ART
, O
growing O
like O
ice O
out O
of O
the O
ground B-ART
. O
They O
are O
made O
, O
as O
you O
recall O
, O
of O
glass B-ART
. O
A O
metal B-ART
apple I-ART
hangs O
rather O
prominently O
from O
one O
of O
them O
. O


Something O
took O
out B-ART
the O
fluorescents O
, O
so O
the O
only O
light B-ART
comes O
from O
your O
helmet's B-ART
forward B-ART
spot O
. O
Since O
you're O
facing O
the O
wall B-ART
you O
twist O
your O
neck O
and O
look O
around O
frantically O
, O
your O
spotlight B-ART
dancing O
across O
the O
remains O
of O
Node O
4 O
, O
before O
you O
realize O
what B-ART
a O
bad O
idea O
moving O
your O
head B-ART
fast O
is O
. O


You O
are O
on O
a O
dirt B-ART
path I-ART
. O
There O
is O
an O
old O
, O
rundown O
mansion B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
a O
swamp B-ART
in O
the O
distance O
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
to O
the O
west O
is O
an O
overgrown B-ART
cemetery I-ART
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
porch B-ART
of O
a O
large B-ART
gothic I-ART
mansion I-ART
. O


You O
are O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
swamp B-ART
. O
There O
are O
the O
distant O
ruins B-ART
of O
an O
old O
mill B-ART
further O
to O
the O
east O
. O


It O
has O
a O
kitchen B-ART
, I-ART
bathroom I-ART
, O
living O
area O
, O
all O
the O
appropriate O
stuff O
. O
There's O
a O
bed B-ART
, O
a O
television B-ART
, O
lots O
of O
books B-ART
and I-ART
DVDs I-ART
on O
shelves B-ART
or O
in O
face O
down O
piles B-ART
. O
North O
is O
the O
exit O
. O


Your O
desk B-ART
is O
in O
the O
northeast O
corner O
of O
this O
room O
, O
that O
you O
share O
with O
four O
other O
MicroSun O
employees O
. O
Their O
desks B-ART
are O
to O
the O
south O
and O
southwest O
of O
here O
. O
To O
the O
west O
, O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
faint O
hum O
of O
the O
printer O
you O
all O
use O
. O
On O
each O
desk B-ART
, O
including O
yours O
, O
sits O
the O
mandatory O
computer B-ART
, O
the O
same O
model O
for O
everyone O
. O
Apart O
from O
that O
, O
your O
desk B-ART
is O
cluttered O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
papers B-ART
, O
half O
of O
which O
you O
don't O
use O
anymore O
. O
The O
other O
half O
you've O
never O
used O
. O
You O
just O
never O
took O
the O
time O
to O
throw O
it O
all O
away O
. O


Benny's B-ART
desk B-ART
is O
even O
more O
cluttered O
than O
your O
own O
. O
If O
you O
would O
ever O
have O
to O
look O
for O
something O
in O
that O
mess B-ART
, O
you'd O
better O
ask O
Benny B-ART
alone O
you'd O
never O
find O
it O
. O
Mind O
you O
, O
maybe O
even O
Benny B-ART
wouldn't O
find O
it O
. O
Benny B-ART
takes O
a O
bite O
from O
a O
sandwich B-ART
. O


This O
part O
of O
the O
room O
is O
usually O
occupied O
by O
Marc O
, O
the O
resident O
database O
specialist O
. O
He O
isn't O
here O
right O
now O
typical O
! O
, O
but O
his O
desk B-ART
is O
still O
here O
, O
taking O
up O
space B-ART
. O
Much O
like O
Marc's O
job O
description O
, O
from O
what O
you've O
seen O
him B-ART
do O
. O
Marc's O
desk B-ART
is O
remarkably O
empty O
. O
There O
is O
the O
mandatory O
computer B-ART
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
there O
are O
not O
nearly O
as O
many O
papers O
as O
on O
the O
other O
desks B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
row B-ART
of I-ART
binders I-ART
on O
the O
desk B-ART
, O
but O
you O
can't O
recall O
anyone O
ever O
using O
one O
of O
them O
it's O
probably O
just O
showing O
off O
by O
Marc O
. O


This O
is O
the O
place O
where O
Benny B-ART
usually O
works O
. O
Benny B-ART
is O
an O
even O
better O
programmer O
than O
you O
are O
one O
day O
you O
hope O
to O
be O
as O
smart O
as O
he O
is O
. O


Benny B-ART
is O
typing O
some O
code O
. O


On O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
is O
a O
whiteboard B-ART
. O
The O
door B-ART
out O
of O
the O
office O
is O
open O
. O
You O
could O
walk O
right O
out O
of O
here O
, O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
. O


Apart O
from O
being O
the O
place O
where O
John O
usually O
works O
, O
this O
is O
also O
the O
place O
where O
you O
can O
enter O
and O
leave O
the O
room O
there O
is O
a O
door B-ART
to O
the O
south O
, O
leading O
to O
freedom O
, O
to O
the O
outside O
, O
to O
Tanya O
. O
. O
. O
But O
only O
when O
you O
have O
finished O
your O
work O
here O
. O


Everyone O
would O
probably O
be O
fighting O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
put O
their O
desk O
here O
, O
if O
it O
wasn't O
for O
the O
constant O
hum B-ART
of O
the O
printer B-ART
on O
the O
windowsill B-ART
. O


This O
part O
of O
the O
room O
is O
generally O
considered O
the O
most O
pleasant O
, O
since O
there O
is O
a O
window B-ART
here O
, O
making O
this O
the O
only O
sunny B-ART
spot O
in O
an O
otherwise O
shadowy O
office O
. O
You O
don't O
see O
what O
the O
fuss O
is O
all O
about O
that's O
what O
neon O
lighting B-ART
was O
invented O
for O
, O
wasn't O
it O
? O
And O
even O
that O
isn't O
necessary O
to O
use O
a O
monitor O
! O


This O
is O
William's B-ART
place O
. O
Although O
his O
desk B-ART
looks O
much O
like O
the O
others O
, O
the O
same O
computer B-ART
, I-ART
stacks I-ART
of O
papers O
and O
so O
on O
, O
the O
difference O
is O
in O
the O
details O
these O
papers O
aren't O
filled O
with O
code O
, O
but O
with O
summaries O
of O
meetings O
, O
plans O
and O
schedules O
. O
William B-ART
continually O
tries O
to O
convey O
the O
impression O
that O
his O
part O
of O
the O
room O
is O
in O
some O
way O
more O
important O
than O
the O
rest O
, O
being O
the O
nerve O
centre O
of O
the O
project O
. O


The O
humble O
furnishings B-ART
elaborate O
the O
typical O
spartan O
collection O
of O
a O
Priestess O
living O
in O
the O
hinterlands O
. O
Having O
said O
that O
however O
, O
your O
hut O
is O
a O
veritable O
mansion O
compared O
to O
the O
sod O
shanties O
that O
the O
settlers O
use O
. O
The O
settlers O
have O
certainly O
been O
good O
to O
you O
since O
your O
arrival O
and O
have O
spared O
nothing O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
make O
things O
more O
comfortable O
. O
In O
your O
hut O
you O
have O
your O
bed B-ART
, O
your O
battle B-ART
chest I-ART
, O
a O
night B-ART
table I-ART
, O
and O
a O
long B-ART
oak I-ART
table I-ART
where O
various O
tomes B-ART
and I-ART
herbs I-ART
lie O
. O
Next O
to O
a O
torch B-ART
on O
the O
wall O
, O
a O
curtained B-ART
opening I-ART
leads O
out O
of O
your O
hut O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
currently O
in O
the O
Western O
Camp O
and O
residential O
area O
where O
most O
of O
the O
villagers O
live O
. O
Your O
hut B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
the O
villagers' O
sod B-ART
shanties I-ART
surround O
you O
on O
all O
sides O
. O
Beyond O
the O
shanties' B-ART
rooftops O
, O
you O
can O
see O
the O
perimeter B-ART
of O
the O
fort's O
western O
wall B-ART
come O
into O
sight O
. O
A O
weathered O
path O
east O
leads O
to O
the O
center O
of O
the O
outpost O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
camp O
. O


A O
huge O
gate B-ART
takes O
up O
most O
of O
the O
eastern O
section O
of O
this O
part O
of O
the O
fort O
. O
This O
is O
the O
entrance O
area O
to O

. O
Aegea O
that O
also O
doubles O
as O
a O
place O
for O
its O
residents O
to O
socialize B-ART
. O
It's O
relatively O
quiet O
at O
the O
moment O
most O
people O
are O
out O
working O
, O
but O
there O
are O
still O
a O
few O
children B-ART
playing O
games O
and O
some O
old B-ART
timers I-ART
busily O
chatting O
their O
mornings O
away O

A O
path O

west O
back O
to O
the O
center O
of O

the O
perimeter B-ART
wall I-ART
of O
the O

As O
the O
rising O
sun O
creeps O
over O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
a O
towering O
shadow O
looms O
, O
leaving O
you O

in O
the O
dark O

Livestock O
usually O
aren't O
allowed O
in O
the O
Fort O

this O
area O
maintains O
a O
herd O
of O
cows B-ART
and O
a O
handful O
of O
chickens B-ART
for O
internal O
egg O

The O
animals B-ART
squawk O
and O
moo O
loudly O
in O
a O
huge O
pen B-ART
that O
takes O
up O
the O
entire O
south O

of O
the O

north O
leads O
back O
to O
the O

you O
can O
just O
make O

Bucketloads O
of O
corn B-ART

The O

such O
a O

The O

It's O
a O
delightful O
little O
shed O
even O
though O
it O
has O
seen O
better O
days O
. O
Wear O

tear O
just O
adds O
to O
the O

The O

there O
are O
several O

This O

What O
commonly O
gets O
called O
a O
swamp O
is O
actually O
the O
most O
extraordinary O
ecosystem O
on O
the O

Water O

You O
are O

But O
now O
that O
the O
wind B-ART
is O
picking O
up O

blowing O
straight O
into O
the O
alley B-ART
, O
you O
doubt O
that O
you'd O
be O
able O

A O
wide O

A O

You O
stand O
at O
a O

with O
the O

A O
large O
building B-ART

The O

To O

This O
street O
continues O
east O

west O
across O
the O
town O

To O
the O
north O
is O
the O
only O
stone B-ART
building I-ART
you've O
seen O
in O
the O
town O

with O
a O
large O
sheriff's O

To O
the O
south O
, O
two B-ART

Suddenly O
the O
wind B-ART
whistles O
, O
and O
a O
tumbleweed B-ART
rolls O
by O
! O


This O
spacious O
barn B-ART
must O
have O
once O
been O
the O
town O
stable O
, O
as O
the O
four B-ART
stalls I-ART
are O
all O
covered O
with O
dried O
straw B-ART

The O
rickety O
walls B-ART
hold O
several O

though O
only O
one O
holds O
anything O

a O

You O
can O
go O

an O

A O
small O
fenced O
in O
area O
stands O
behind O
the O
stable O
, O
the O
stout O
wooden O
posts B-ART
looking O
fit O
to O
hold O
a O
bucking O
bronco O
with O
a O
double O
gate B-ART
offering O
the O
only O
entrance O
. O
But O
the O
corral O
is O
mostly O
bare O
, O
save O
for O
a O
mule B-ART
looking O
lonely O
and O
forlorn O
in O
the O
far O
corner O
. O
Ah O
, O
you O
remember O
the O
tour O
guide O
promised O
the O
children O
a O
mule B-ART
ride O
, O
didn't O
he O
? O
But O
he O
also O
held O
up O
chaps B-ART
and O
spurs O
, O
claiming O
that O
Molly B-ART
the I-ART
Mule B-ART
really O
rubbed O
some O
people O
the O
wrong O
way O
and O
needed O
a O
bit O
of O
sharp O
encouragement O
to O
move O
forward O
. O
And O
you're O
sure O
he O
said O
something O
about O
a O
saddle O
. O
. O
. O
The O
Corral O
borders O
a O
wide O
expansive O
field O
to O
the O
south O
which O
is O
also O
mostly O
barren O
typical O
of O
the O
landscape O
you've O
become O
accustomed O
to O

You O
are O
standing O
in O
what O

only O
be O
the O
sheriff's O
office O

A O
stout O
desk B-ART
sits O
before O
you O

carved O
on O
the O

A O
rifle B-ART

There O
are O
two B-ART

one O
of O
the O

The O
back O
of O
the O

caged O
off O
into O
a O

Inside O
is O
a O
sight O
for O
sore O
eyes B-ART
indeed O
a O
cot B-ART
, O
whose O
supple O
leather O
looks O
like O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
rest O
! O


Standing O

in O
this O
one O
horse O

Life O

stone O
path B-ART
runs O
north O
and O
south O
through O
the O
center O
of O
the O
graveyard O
. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
path B-ART
is O
an O
old O
wooden O
bench B-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
a O
vicious O
gnarled O
old O
tree O
, O
to O
the O
west O
is O
an O
ancient O
, O
leprous O
, O
small O
stone O
crypt O
. O


The O
northern O
end O
of O
the O
graveyard B-ART
has O
three O
wonderfully O
unique O
tombstones B-ART
climbing O
up O
out O
of O
the O
bare O
earth O
. O
A O
stone O
path B-ART
runs O
south O
through O
the O
center O
of O
the O
graveyard B-ART
. O


The O
grass O
is O
overgrown O
on O
the O
west O
side O
of O
the O
graveyard O
. O
You O
spot O
the O
stone O
crypt B-ART
camouflaged O
by O
the O
darkness O
. O


Here O
on O
the O
east O
side O
of O
the O
graveyard O
towers O
a O
knotted O
old O
oak O
tree B-ART
waving O
slightly O
in O
the O
ghostly O
breeze O
. O


More O
by O
memory O
than O
by O
the O
dim O
light B-ART
can O
you O
find O
your O
way O
south O
to O
the O
kitchen O
or O
east O
to O
your O
workshop O
. O
The O
back B-ART
door I-ART
is O
a O
faint B-ART
outline I-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


This O
side O
of O
the O
yard B-ART
is O
green O
and O
almost O
perfectly O
level O
. O
The O
night B-ART
air I-ART
is O
just O
the O
right O
temperature O
, O
and O
you O
have O
an O
excellent O
view O
of O
the O
stars B-ART
. O
As O
long O
as O
the O
wind B-ART
isn't O
blowing O
out B-ART
of O
the O
trees B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
it O
smells O
just O
as O
pleasant O
. O


You've O
never O
entirely O
subscribed O
to O
that O
everything B-ART
in O
its O
place O
maxim O
, O
but O
there O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
bed B-ART
here O
. O
This O
is O
where O
you O
do O
the O
majority O
of O
your O
dreaming O
, O
but O
now O
you've O
got O
more O
important O
things O
to O
do O
. O


It's O
very O
dark O
in O
here O
, O
and O
the O
room B-ART
is O
filled O
with O
junk B-ART
. O
You O
have O
to O
rely O
mostly O
on O
your O
sense O
of O
touch O
to O
identify O
individual B-ART
objects B-ART
. O


You O
again O
stare O
in O
disbelief O
at O
your O
filthy B-ART
floor O
. O
The O
faintly O
glowing B-ART
remains B-ART
of O
yesterday's O
fire B-ART
reveal O
your O
sewing O
room B-ART
to O
the O
east O
and O
the O
front O
door B-ART
to O
your O
south O
. O


It's O
here O
that O
you O
do O
all O
your O
sewing B-ART
work O
. O
Often O
your O
neighbors B-ART
will O
bring O
you O
clothes O
to O
alter O
or O
other O
pieces O
to O
make O
. O


Two O
fence B-ART
lines I-ART
extend O
southward O
toward O
the O
main B-ART
gate I-ART
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
farm B-ART
stretches O
away O
to O
the O
east O
and O
west O
. O


You're O
in O
pleasant B-ART
meadows I-ART
south O
of O
the O
domesticated O
animal B-ART
pens O
. O


This O
narrow O
gully B-ART
runs O
south O
towards O
the O
main B-ART
gate I-ART
, O
and O
is O
fenced B-ART
on O
both B-ART
sides O
. O


A O
dirt B-ART
road I-ART
runs O
south O
to O
the O
state B-ART
highway I-ART
, O
some O
two B-ART
and O
a O
half O
miles O
distant O
. O


And O
so O
it O
stands O
before O
you O
, O
a O
house B-ART
that O
could O
have O
been O
cozy O
, O
if O
not O
for O
the O
peeling B-ART
blue I-ART
paint I-ART
, O
the O
flying O
gargoyles B-ART
encircling O
the O
roof B-ART
, O
and O
the O
looming O
twelve O
foot O
tall O
fence B-ART
with O
' O
WARNING B-ART
Electrified' O
painted B-ART
in O
blood B-ART
red I-ART
letters I-ART
. O
The O
yard B-ART
on O
this O
side O
of O
the O
fence B-ART
continues O
to O
the O
east O
and O
west O
. O
The O
main O
gate B-ART
, O
dutifully O
keeping O
you O
out O
of O
Alden B-ART
Manor I-ART
proper O
, O
lies O
directly O
to O
the O
north O
. O
If O
you O
wish O
to O
give O
up O
on O
this O
grand O
adventure O
, O
there O
is O
a O
path B-ART
leading O
south O
back O
to O
civilization O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
east O
of O
the O
front O
gate B-ART
. O
The O
eastern O
yard B-ART
of I-ART
Alden I-ART
Manor I-ART
is O
visible O
just O
beyond O
the O
gate B-ART
. O
The O
fence B-ART
continues O
in O
this O
direction O
and O
looks O
quite O
grim O
. O
Every O
now O
and O
again O
it O
creaks B-ART
even O
when O
there's O
no O
wind B-ART
. O
Nearby O
several O
storm B-ART
crows I-ART
nest O
on O
telephone B-ART
wires I-ART
attached O
to O
a O
rather O
gaunt O
pole B-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
west O
of O
the O
front O
gate B-ART
. O
The O
fence B-ART
continues O
in O
this O
direction O
until O
it O
fades O
into O
darkness B-ART
further O
west O
. O
At O
the O
base O
of O
the O
fence B-ART
there O
is O
a O
utility B-ART
box I-ART
. O
On O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
fence B-ART
, O
you O
can O
see O
into O
the O
west O
yard B-ART
of I-ART
Alden I-ART
Manor I-ART
. O
You O
can O
return O
back O
to O
the O
front O
gate B-ART
by O
going O
east O
. O


You O
are O
clinging O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
telephone B-ART
pole I-ART
roughly O
40 O
feet O
from O
the O
ground B-ART
. O
It's O
quite O
a O
view B-ART
! O
A O
telephone B-ART
wire I-ART
runs O
over O
the O
fence B-ART
and O
spans O
across O
to O
the O
house B-ART
. O


From O
this O
small O
office O
you O
write O
, O
edit O
, O
print O
, O
and O
distribute O
the O
Malnoxet O
Gazette O
, O
the O
finest O
newspaper B-ART
on O
the O
northern O
frontier O
. O
It's O
also O
quite O
possibly O
the O
only O
newspaper B-ART
on O
the O
northern O
frontier O
. O


This O
is O
your O
room O
only O
because O
it's O
slightly O
too O
big O
to O
be O
called O
a O
closet O
. O
There's O
barely O
enough O
room O
in O
here O
for O
your O
bed B-ART
, O
and O
the O
piles B-ART
of I-ART
newspapers I-ART
and I-ART
stove I-ART
are O
tempting O
fate O
by O
being O
in O
such O
close O
proximity O
. O
At O
least O
you've O
managed O
to O
avoid O
the O
splattering O
of O
old O
ink O
that O
coat O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
office O
. O


One O
cupboard B-ART
in O
particular O
demands O
your O
attention O
and O
a O
body B-ART
slumped O
on O
the O
floor O
brings O
back O
uneasy O
memories O
. O
The O
open O
doorway O
is O
South O
. O


The O
'Treatment' O
room O
. O
All O
the O
inmates O
associate O
this O
place O
with O
pain O
and O
suffering O
. O
Threatening O
machinery O
glares O
at O
you O
from O
around O
the O
walls B-ART
. O


I O
can O
also O
see O
A O
rather B-ART
large I-ART
fire I-ART
, O
blocking O
the O
stairway O
down O
. O


It O
has O
the O
mediocre O
nicety O
of O
a O
place O
that O
doesn't O
want O
to O
look O
cheap O
. O
Two B-ART
Two I-ART
sleeping I-ART
bags I-ART
are O
rolled O
up O
behind O
a O
plywood B-ART
table I-ART
, O
with O
a O
dark O
brown O
and O
mostly O
empty O
Cabinet B-ART
on O
the O
wall O
. O
This O
place O
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
, O
smells O
like O
air O
freshener O
with O
a O
tang O
of O
fish O
and O
the O
floor O
is O
moving O
. O
So O
, O
being O
here O
is O
like O
throwing O
up O
on O
a O
disco O
toilet O
. O
A O
small O
stair O
leads O
up O
, O
to O
the O
stern O
. O


The O
stern O
is O
quite O
spacious O
. O
It O
has O
to O
be O
, O
as O
it O
not O
only O
contains O
a O
bench B-ART
that O
runs O
along O
it O
, O
but O
also O
a O
sort O
of O
huge O
, O
white O
supporter O
on O
which O
rests O
Uncle B-ART

A O
small O
town O

, O
complete O
with O
framed B-ART

a O
ticket B-ART
office I-ART

The O
building O
is O
painted O
white O

Main O
Street O
lies O
to O
the O
west O
. O


You're O
in O
an O
abandoned O
barbershop O
. O
Apparently O
on O
one O
is O
in O
need O
of O
a O
shave O
or O
haircut O
today O
. O
You O
also O
notice O
some O
writing B-ART
on O
the O
wall O
. O
The O
only O
exit O
is O
north O
to O
the O
street O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
telegraph B-ART
office O
. O
There's O
a O
certain O
atmosphere O
of O
effectiveness O
and O
punctualness O
. O
The O
only O
exit O
is O
south O
to O
Main O
St O
. O


This O
is O
a O
large B-ART
square O
room O
with O
many O
tables B-ART
and I-ART
chairs I-ART
for O
guests O
. O
Behind O
the O
bar B-ART
is O
a O
large B-ART
mirror I-ART
. O
Strangely O
, O
the O
room O
seems O
deserted O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
wooden O
building O
with O
white O
walls O
and O
many O
shelves B-ART
. O
A O
few O
customers B-ART
are O
browsing O
the O
goods B-ART
. O
There's O
an O
exit O
south O
to O
Main O
St O
. O


You O
give O
the O
place O
a O
once O
over O
with O
your O
right O
eye O
. O
Then O
you O
turn O
your O
head O
and O
look O
at O
everything B-ART
through O
your O
left O
eye O
. O
It O
doesn't O
make O
any O
difference O
. O
The O
farther O
parts O
of O
the O
room O
remain O
out B-ART
of O
focus O
. O


The O
room B-ART
is O
a O
cube B-ART
, O
about O
20 O
feet O
on O
each O
side O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
, O
floor O
, O
and O
ceiling B-ART
are O
all O
made O
of O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
beige O
plastic B-ART
. O
There O
are O
no O
visible O
doors O
or O
windows O
, O
and O
the O
plastic B-ART
itself O
seems O
to O
be O
giving O
off O
light O

Your O
shrine O
has O
seen O
better O
days O
. O
The O
gold O
plate O
is O
peeling O
off O
your O
two O
statues O
one O
male B-ART
, O
one O
female O
, O
embracing O
, O
and O
the O
floor O
is O
fuzzed O
with O
mold B-ART
and O
the O
candywrappers O
of O
tourists O
. O
The O
sarcophagus B-ART
itself O
could O
handle O
a O
refurbishing O
as O
well O
. O
A O
V O
shaped O
trough B-ART
leads O
south O
into O
the O
rest O

This O
is O
the O
hub O
of O
the O
shrine O
complex O
. O
Wondrous O
tapestries B-ART
and I-ART
treasures I-ART
and O
all O
that O
good O
stuff O
are O
all O
around O
. O
A O
dingy O
little O
hallway O
leads O
north O
to O
your O
shrine O
. O


Your O
stall O
is O
wooden O
structure O
lined O
with O
straw B-ART
. O
It O
smells O
a O
little O
unpleasant O
. O
Another O
stall O
lies O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
enclosure B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
north O
and O
east O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
on O
the O
yellow O
grit B-ART
path I-ART
that O
runs O
to O
the O
south O
of O
your O
enclosure B-ART
. O
The O
path B-ART
winds O
towards O
you O
from O
the O
west O
and O
continues O
to O
the O
east O
, O
interrupted O
only O
by O
a O
broad O
wooden B-ART
bridge I-ART
spanning O
a O
gently O
flowing O
river B-ART
. O
The O
river B-ART
runs O
along O
the O
eastern O
border O
of O
your O
enclosure B-ART
and O
continues O
babbling O
south O
; O
another O
path B-ART
breaks O
off O
to O
follow O
it O
. O


You O
come O
to O
a O
crossroads O
of O
sorts O
. O
A O
path B-ART
runs O
north O
and O
south O
along O
the O
western O
bank O
of O
the O
river B-ART
, O
while O
another O
runs O
off O
to O
the O
west O
. O


You O
stand O
at O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
lion B-ART
enclosure I-ART
. O
A O
strong O
, O
high O
fence B-ART
separates O
you O
from O
the O
dangers O
lurking O
within O
. O
One O
of O
whom O
is O
standing O
there O
looking O
at O
you O
through O
the O
gate B-ART
. O
A O
path B-ART
rises O
back O
eastwards O
to O
an O
observation B-ART
platform B-ART
and O
beyond O
. O


You O
stand O
before O
the O
gate B-ART
of O
a O
small O
enclosure B-ART
that O
looks O
more O
like O
a O
rockery O
garden O
. O
The O
path O
runs O
east O
to O
west O
here O
, O
but O
further O
progress O
westwards O
has O
been O
made O
impossible O
by O
a O
cattle B-ART
grid I-ART
. O
Which O
is O
a O
shame O
, O
really O
, O
as O
you've O
heard O
there O
are O
kangaroos O
and O
wombats O
down O
this O
way O
. O


You O
are O
in O
long O
curving O
room O
; O
almost O
a O
corridor O
, O
in O
fact O
. O
It O
curves O
around O
to O
the O
west O
and O
to O
the O
south O
. O
The O
inner O
of O
the O
two O
walls O
is O
made O
up O
of O
a O
series O
of O
tanks B-ART
, O
each B-ART
of O
which O
contains O
stones B-ART
, I-ART
vegetation I-ART

heat O

and O
so O
on O
. O
Everything B-ART
to O
keep O
a O
reptile B-ART
happy O
. O
What O
you O
don't O
see O
are O
many O
actual O
reptiles B-ART
? O
presumably O
they O
have O
hidden O
themselves O
away O
to O
sleep O
. O
The O
tank B-ART
in O
front O
of O
which O
you O
now O
stand O
, O
though O
, O
is O
an O
exception O
. O


You O
are O
in O
long O
room O
, O
or O
possibly O
a O
wide O
corridor O
, O
that O
curves O
around O
to O
the O
north O
and O
to O
the O
west O
. O
Lining O
the O
inner O
of O
the O
two O
walls O
is O
a O
series O
of O
large O
tanks B-ART

each B-ART
of O
which O
contains O
the O
paraphernalia B-ART
associated O
with O
well O
cared O
for O
reptiles B-ART
? O
branches B-ART

logs B-ART

so O
on O
. O
The O
reptiles B-ART
themselves O
, O
though O
, O
are O
hard O
to O
spot O
; O
possibly O
it's O
the O
dim O
light O
, O
possibly O
they've O
hidden O
themselves O
away O
to O
sleep O
. O
In O
one O
of O
these O
tanks B-ART
, O
though O
, O
the O
occupant O
is O
clearly O
visible O
. O


The O
pathway B-ART
on O
which O
you O
stand O
is O
bounded O
by O
low O
stone B-ART
walls I-ART
as O
it O
runs O
over O
a O
weir B-ART
. O
The O
weir B-ART
separates O
the O
pond B-ART
to O
the O
northeast O
from O
the O
lake B-ART
that O
expands O
away O
, O
at O
a O
lower O
level O
, O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
The O
path B-ART
runs O
north O
, O
following O
the O
river B-ART
that O
feeds O
the O
pond B-ART
, O
and O
south O
to O
a O
wide O
paved O
area O
. O
You O
can O
see O
another O
path B-ART
running O
west O
which O
would O
have O
remained O
inconspicuous O
had O
some O
fool O
not O
seen O
fit O
to O
stick O
a O
sign B-ART
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it O
. O


You O
emerge O
into O
what O
is O

in O
a O
small O

away O
from O

This O
could O
be O

it's O
quite O
original O

it O
didn't O
stop O
this O

In O
fact O
, O

are O
good O

and O
the O

shows O
its O
difference O
from O
its O
rivals O
with O
a O
certain O
sense O
of O

and O
reflexion O
it O
still O
is O
a O

, O
but O
let's O
say O
that O
you O
take O
advantage O
of O
a O
higher O

You O
have O
a O

but O
being O
a O
social O
sheep O
, O
you O
decided O
to O
opt O
for O
conformity O
. O


Like O

a O

A O

Some O
laughed O

This O

You're O
about O
half O

The O
hill's B-ART
modest O

To O
either O
side O

giant O
oak B-ART

so O
close O

that O
not O

a O

stretch O
so O
far O

that O
they O
seem O
to O
touch O
the O

Underneath O
their O
boughs O
, O
the O
path B-ART
I O
walk O
is O
as O
dusky O

I O
know O
the O
hour O

A O
rectangular O
grid B-ART

stretch O
out B-ART
around O

. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
an O
angular O
white O
marble O
building B-ART
with O
a O

rises O
from O
the O

a O

The O

mounted O
in O
an O
equally O
weathered O
heavy O
iron O
fence B-ART

which O
circles O
the O

The O
tops O
of O
ancient B-ART
oaks I-ART
peer O
over O
the O

The O
undergrowth B-ART
from O
the O

is O
thick O

prevents O
further O
progress O
in O
that O
direction O

Here O
brambles O
have O
taken O
over O
the O
way O

and O
block O
it O
completely O
except O
for O
a O
path B-ART
leading O

I'm O

Roots B-ART
criss O
cross O
the O
path B-ART
here O

make O
the O

lumpy O

I'm O
on O
a O
slowly O

path B-ART
through O
the O

on O
a O
long O

The O
door B-ART
to O
the O
south O
leads O
out O
into O
the O
foggy O
night O
, O
and O
that O
seems O
like O
a O
good O
place O
to O
start O
. O


You O
hadn't O
realised O
until O
stepping O
out O
tonight O
how O
dim O
the O
fog B-ART
could O
be O
. O
The O
pea B-ART
souper I-ART
spreads O
out O
in O
all O
directions O
, O
obscuring O
your O
vision O

The O
steps O
leading O
down O

into O
it O

Back O

Pea O
souper B-ART
fog B-ART
blankets O
everything B-ART
. O
You O
know O
more O
by O
instinct O
than O
anything O
else O
that O
the O
way O
home O
is O
just O
to O
the O
north O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
all O
the O
streets O
leading O
out O
from O
here O
are O
alien O
to O
you O
. O


The O
cemetary O
is O
quite O
small O
. O
It O
used O
to O
be O
the O
private O
graveyard B-ART
for O
the O
generations O
of O
Sherwoods O
that O
lived O
in O
the O
house O
. O
About O
thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
Elbert O
Sherwood O
opened O
the O
cemetary O
for O
the O
entire O
village O
. O
And O
ten O
years O
ago O
, O
after O
the O
remaining O
Sherwoods O
were O
murdered O
on O
Halloween B-ART
, O
the O
town O
alderman O
renamed O
the O
cemetary O
. O
A O
fence O
surrounds O
the O
cemetary O
, O
separating O
it O
from O
the O
woods O
to O
your O
west O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
cemetary O
to O
your O
north O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
out B-ART
by O
the O
road B-ART
, O
and O
a O
large O
mountain B-ART
looms O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
it O
. O
You O
can O
barely O
make O
out B-ART
the O
faint O
, O
white O
noise O
of O
rushing O
water O
coming O
far O
from O
the O
southeast O
. O
To O
the O
west O
of O
you O
is O
a O
clearing O
in O
the O
briers O
which O
provides O
an O
entrance O
to O
the O
woods O
. O


You O
are O
on O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
dirt O
trail B-ART
in O
the O
woods O
that O
leads O
north O
. O
A O
clearing O
in O
the O
briers O
to O
the O
east O
will O
take O
back O
to O
the O
road O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
campsite O
that O
you O
and O
Fred B-ART
made O
years O
ago O
. O
A O
large O
, O
dome O
shaped O
tent B-ART
sits O
on O
the O
dirt O
. O
A O
nice O
fire B-ART
blazes O
in O
the O
firepit B-ART
. O
Most O
of O
the O
leaves O
have O
been O
cleared O
out B-ART
of O
this O
roughly O
fifty O

fifty O
foot O
area O
. O
The O
trail O
which O
brought O
you O
here O
continues O
north O
, O
or O
you O
can O
head O
back O
south O
towards O
the O
road O
. O


You O
are O
on O
a O
bank O
of O
Brown O
River B-ART
, O
which O
is O
to O
the O
east O
. O
It O
appears O
to O
have O
a O
strong O
current O
. O
The O
roaring O
ambient O
sound O
of O
water O
rushing O
down O
the O
river B-ART
is O
so O
loud O
here O
that O
it O
drowns O
out B-ART
all O
other O
sounds O
of O
the O
area O
. O
A O
path O
leads O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O


This O
is O
where O
you O
work O
. O
You O
spend O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
your O
conscious O
life O
here O
in O
what O
some O
might O
consider O
tedium O
and O
drudgery O
. O
The O
desk B-ART
by O
the O
window B-ART
is O
, O
unprecedently O
, O
devoid O
of O
brochures O
. O
A O
door B-ART
leads O
out O
. O


A O
drive B-ART
wide O
enough O
for O
several O
coaches O
side O

the O
imposing O
facade B-ART
of I-ART
Hamilton I-ART
Hall I-ART
, O
occasional O
residence O
of O
Lord B-ART
Stoattrouser I-ART

The O
gravel B-ART
is O
flanked O
on O
either O
side O
by O
stands O
of O
poplars B-ART
and I-ART
yews I-ART
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
your O
booth B-ART
, O
and O
to O
the O
east O
are O
the O
gardens O
. O
South O
apparently O
takes O
you O
outside O
the O
grounds O
. O


You O
stand O
on O
the O
top O
step B-ART
between O
marble O
pilasters B-ART

Facing O
you O
are O
the O
open O

while O
a O

lead O
through O
the O
rose B-ART

converge O
here O

The O
gardens B-ART
are O
oddly O
deserted O
except O
for O
a O
strange B-ART

sitting O
on O
a O

near O
the O
peonies B-ART

Three O
paths O
from O
the O
west O

northeast O

southeast O
meet O
at O
an O
oak B-ART
tree I-ART
. O


Although O
visited O
less O
often O
, O
the O
grounds O
had O
to O
be O
completed O
with O
two O
ornamental O
gateposts B-ART
; O
something O
makes O
you O
think O
of O
the O
grey O
stone O
eagles B-ART
perched O
atop O
them O
more O
as O
vultures O
. O
The O
house O
looks O
imposing O
in O
the O
northern O
landscape B-ART
even O
from O
this O
distance O
, O
and O
a O
path O
leads O
northeast O
through O
the O

you O

The O
word O
room O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
misnomer O
; O
it's O
more O
of O
a O
nook O

and O
a O
sparse O
one O

In O
the O
middle O
of O

dark O

Even O
back O
when O
you O
had O
electricity O

the O

wasn't O
all O
that O

, O

here O
a O

there's O

a O

, O
the O
vast O
number O

over O

here O
will O

Harrington B-ART
House B-ART

not O
nearly O
as O
grand O
as O
expected O

Mother O
talks O
about O
the O
history O

within O
its O
walls O

yes O
, O
it's O
clearly O
old O
, O
but O
it's O
unimpressive O

From O
a O
distance O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
an O
ordinary O
suburban O
bungalow B-ART

Close O
up O

it O
simply O
looks O
rundown O

The O

You O
stand O
right O
next O

your O

It O
is O
blue O

You O
can O
see O
a O
small O

The O
tall O

in O
the O
chill O

there O
don't O
seem O

any O

bring O
a O

A O
cobbled O
path O
cuts O
a O
narrow O
slice O
through O
the O
overgrown O

another O

the O

The O
old O

a O
little O
under O
your O

To O
the O
south O

a O
set O
of O
creaking O

the O

A O
small O

dark B-ART
grey O

A O

There O

a O

at O
this O

it's O

Your O

Most O
of O
the O

this O

evade O
your O
understanding O
you're O
a O
soldier O

not O
a O
specialist O

the O

the O

up O

A O

The O
size O
of O
the O
forest O
to O
the O
north O
is O
concealed O
by O
two B-ART
sheer O
rockfaces O
protruding O
from O
the O
northeast O

A O
thin O
curtain B-ART
of I-ART
vines I-ART
drapes O
across O
the O
opening O
to O
the O
north O
, O
giving O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
beaded B-ART
screen O
. O
The O
surrounding O
rockfaces O
hidden O
by O
the O
trees B-ART
, O
are O
too O
steep O
to O
climb O
the O
trees B-ART
look O
unsupportive O
of O
attempts O
to O
climb O
them O
. O


The O
forest O
retreats O
into O
a O
small O
clearing O
here O
, O
with O
a O
solitary O
Holly B-ART
bush I-ART
dominating O
the O

A O

A O
hawthorn B-ART
tree I-ART

just O
off O
to O
the O
side O
of O
the O
path O
, O
in O
full O
bloom O
. O
The O
gnarled O
trunk O
gives O
the O
tree B-ART
a O
weathered O
appearance O
, O
whilst O
an O
odd O
scent O
wafts O
from O
its O
branches O
, O
reminiscent O
of O
decaying O
things O
no O
doubt O
the O
pollen O
from O
its O
flowers B-ART
. O
The O
tree B-ART
stands O
at O
a O

in O
the O

which O
runs O
from O
the O

A O
pungent O
aroma O
floats O
across O
the O

the O
warm O

hits O
the O

of O
the O
juniper B-ART
bush I-ART
growing O
in O
the O

The O
path O
terminates O
here O
in O
a O
shady O
clearing O
. O
The O
shadows O
cast O
by O
the O
canopy O
above B-ART
has O
enticed O
a O
riotous O
growth O
of O
brambles B-ART
to O
come O
forth O

At O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
mass O
of O

is O
a O
small O
rose B-ART

with O
a O

the O
luck O
to O
live O
in O
a O
fine O
avenue B-ART
with O
a O
lot O
of O
trees B-ART
, O
which O
conduct O
to O
north O
in O
a O
square B-ART
the O
maritime B-ART
pines I-ART
which O
adorn O
the O
avenue B-ART
create O
a O
natural O
barrier O
between O
the O
road B-ART
and O
the O
canal B-ART
that O
skirt O
, O
guaranteeing O
a O
little O
shade B-ART
. O
The O
sole O
flaw O
is O
the O
multitude O
of O
mosquitos B-ART
, O
which O
fixed O
in O
the O
canal B-ART
their O
headquarter O
. O
From O
a O

A O

The O
square B-ART
, O
which O
accommodate O
a O
fountain B-ART
with O
a O
feeble O
spurt B-ART
, O
today O
is O
very O
crowded B-ART
, O
because O
there's O
the O
weekly B-ART
market I-ART
in O
the O
northern O
and O
eastern O
road B-ART

In O
this O
street B-ART
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
buildings B-ART

that O
though O
impede O
the O
transit O
of O
the O
wind O
almost O
guarantee O
a O
little O
shade O
. O
In O
this O
road B-ART
, O
in O
addiction O
to O
the O
great O
number O

spend O
your O

no O

how O
many O

I've O
been O

it O

there's O
a O

Perhaps O
it O

that O

I O

nothing O

Everything B-ART
I O
see O
is O
as O
it O

not O
death O

coming O

the O

A O
very O

you O

down O

quite O

inconsiderate O
of O
the O

No O

A O

You O

it O

that O
the O

You O
think O
you O
see O
a O

, O
as O
you O
strain O
your O

through O

You O
hear O

heads O
north O
along O
the O

To O
the O
east O
you O
can O
see O
the O
horror O
and O
the O
beauty O
which O
brought O
you O
here O
, O
the O
desert B-ART
sand O
and O
its O
hidden O
treasure O
. O
The O

You O
are O
in O
the O
desert B-ART
, O
east O
of O
the O
encampment O
. O
From O
this O
distance O
the O
camp O
seems O
little O
more O
than O
a O
mirage O
, O
an O
image O
of O
another O
reality O
which O
has O
little O
to O
do O
with O
the O
brutal O
, O
searing O
reality O
of O
the O
desert B-ART
, O
your O
quickly O
dehydrating O
body O
, O
or O
your O
painfully O
broiling O
feet O
. O


You O
are O
far O
into O
the O
desert B-ART
, O
sand O
and O
more O
sand O
stretching O
out O
endlessly O
around O
you O
in O
all O
directions O
. O
You O
think O
of O
going O
back B-ART
, O
of O
giving O
up O
this O
attempt O
at O
riches O
, O
but O
what O
awaits O
you O
back B-ART
in O
the O
States O
? O
What O
is O
there O
worth O
going O
back B-ART
to O
, O
with O
nothing O
to O
show O
for O
this O
quest O
? O
And O
how O
could O
you O
go O
back B-ART
now O
, O
after O
the O
things O
you'd O
said O
to O
Craige O
? O
You O
glance O
around O
at O
the O
rolling O
dunes O
and O
force O
back B-ART
the O
fear O
eating O
away O
your O
confidence O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
on O
the O
top O
of O
a O
sand O
dune O
, O
looking O
all O
around O
at O
a O
place O
on O
Earth O
where O
man O
was O
never O
meant O
to O
be O
. O
That O
is O
the O
only O
conclusion O
you O
can O
draw O
as O
you O
force O
yourself O
to O
breathe O
the O
hot O
, O
arid O
air B-ART
of O
the O
desert B-ART
through O
your O
nose O
. O
Breathing O
through O
your O
mouth O
makes O
you O
instantly O
thirsty O
, O
a O
dangerous O
state O
to O
find O
yourself O
in O
while O
surrounded O
by O
sand O
. O
You O
curse O
Craige O
, O
then O
find O
yourself O
cursing O
Ellingsworth O
, O
too O
. O


You O
are O
deep O
into O
the O
desert B-ART
, O
as O
deep O
as O
anyone O
in O
his O
right O
mind O
would O
ever O
care O
to O
venture O
. O
A O
small O
but O
strong O
gust O
of O
wind O
reaches O
your O
face O
, O
pelting O
you O
with O
grains O
of O
sand O
so O
small O
they O
remind O
you O
of O
fine O
sugar O
. O
Even O
with O
your O
lips O
tightly O
closed O
, O
the O
wind O
manages O
to O
drive O
a O
few O
grains O
into O
your O
mouth O
. O
You O
are O
thankful O
that O
none O
got O
into O
your O
eyes O
. O
There's O
a O
sizable O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
sand O

A O

the O

exactly O
two O

you O

you O

there O

Your O
empty B-ART

cold B-ART
metal I-ART

You O
thought O
this O

would O
be O
more O
emotional O

cathartic O
even O
. O
But O
standing O
there O
smoking O
gun O
in O

, O
with O
your O
quarry O
finally O
dead O
at O
your O
feet O
you O
feel O
curiously O
empty O
. O
Well O
, O
perhaps O
you O
just O
need O
time O
to O
let O
what O
you O
have O
done O
and O
what O
it O
means O
sink O
in O
. O
But O
time O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
luxury O
you O
have O
right O
now O
. O
The O
shot O
will O
have O
been O
heard O
, O
and O
the O
police O
will O
have O
been O
called O
. O
The O
one O
thing O
working O
in O
your O

might O
be O
that O
the O
apartment B-ART
you O
rented O
for O
the O
occasion O
is O
just O
a O
few O
blocks O
up O
the O
street O
. O
Keep O
your O
friends O
close O
and O
you O
enemies O
closer O
, O
as O
they O
say O
. O
You O
never O
did O
waste O
much O
thought O
on O
what O
would O
happen O
. O
. O
. O
after O
, O
but O
maybe O
you O
do O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
back O
home O
and O
make O
some O
plans O
. O
Maybe O
. O
Not O
much O
of O
a O
chance O
probably O

it O

all O
you O

your O
face O
, O
and O
you O
can O
see O
molten O
lava B-ART
far O
below O
. O
Needless O
to O
say O
, O
it's O
extremely O
hot O
here O
, O
and O
quite O
a O
bit O
dangerous O
. O


The O
room O
is O
a O
perfect O
cube O
, O
about O
30 O
feet O
on O
a O
side O
. O
The O
ceiling B-ART
is O
yellow O
and O
the O
floor O
is O
purple O
. O
The O
north O
wall O
is O
blue O
, O
and O
the O
eastern O
wall O
is O
green O
. O
To O
the O
south O
, O
the O
wall O
is O
orange O
, O
and O
the O
western O
wall O
is O
red O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
bare O
of O
ornament O
, O
and O
no O
furniture O
occupies O
the O
room O
. O


A O
small O
, O
circular O
room O
, O
carved O
out B-ART
of O
the O
depths O
of O
the O
Mother B-ART
Tree I-ART
. O
What O
little O
light O
there O
is O
trickles O
in O
from O
a O
long O
hallway O
to O
the O
north O
. O


From O
this O
vantage O
point O
, O
you O
can O
see O
most O
of O
the O
north O
face O
of O
your O
Mother B-ART
Tree I-ART
. O
Far O
above O
you O
is O
Citadel O
Bleph O
, O
founded O
by O
your O
own O
great O
ancestors O
generations O
ago O
. O
Far O
below O
, O
all O
details O
of O
the O
surface O
are O
lost O
to O
haze O
. O
You O
can O
vaguely O
discern O
the O
great O
Milk O
Sea O
, O
and O
the O
Rainbow O
Spot O
within O
it O
. O


This O
building O
is O
dominated O
by O
enormous O
telescopes B-ART
and O
other O
optical O
instruments O
, O
all O
pointed O
across O
The O
Great O
Gap O
. O
No O
signal O
from O
the O
Lower O
Forest O
has O
been O
received O
for O
generations O
, O
yet O
the O
scientists O
live O
in O
hope O
. O
Indeed O
, O
it O
is O
to O
them O
you O
owe O
your O
mission O
, O
for O
it O
was O
they O
who O
spotted O
the O
asteroid O
plummeting O
downwards O
. O
The O
asteroid O
you O
are O
now O
sworn O
to O
retrieve O
. O


This O
building O
is O
among O
the O
lowest O
on O
the O
Mother B-ART
Tree I-ART
, O
although O
it O
remains O
safely O
above O
the O
surface O
. O
The O
research O
pod B-ART
is O
here O
, O
waiting O
to O
take O
you O
down O
to O
the O
surface O
, O
where O
you O
are O
expected O
to O
retrieve O
the O
asteroid O
. O


The O
research O
pod O
is O
incredibly O
cramped O
. O
There's O
just O
enough O
room O
for O
two O
levers B-ART
one O
labeled O
DOWN O
and O
the O
other O
UP O
. O
There's O
also O
a O
small O
window B-ART
. O


Strands O
of O
light O
filter O
down O
as O
though O
through O
a O
liquid O
sieve O
. O
The O
water B-ART
is O
pleasantly O
warm O
after O
a O
long O
day O
of O
equatorial O
sun O
. O


The O
water B-ART
here O
is O
colder O
than O
at O
the O
surface O
, O
and O
the O
twisted O
towers O
of O
kelp B-ART
sway O
in O
a O
slow O
current O
, O
tangling O
and O
masking O
your O
rising O
hose B-ART
. O
The O
boat B-ART
is O
just O
barely O
visible O
a O
small O
black O
flaw O
in O
a O
span O
of O
sapphire O
. O


Luminescent O
polyps B-ART
line O
the O
walls B-ART
of O
this O
tight O
crevice B-ART
. O
Their O
delicate O
fronds B-ART
wave O
in O
the O
icy O
water B-ART
. O
You O
would O
be O
nearly O
blind O
without O
their O
weak O
colored O
light O
. O


Between O
the O
rock B-ART
ceiling I-ART
and I-ART
white I-ART
sand I-ART
floor O
hangs O
three O
feet O
of O
inky O
water B-ART
filled O
with O
bustling O
movement O
. O
At O
the O
back O
of O
the O
cave O
you O
can O
see O
a O
monstrous B-ART
whiskered I-ART
shape I-ART
, I-ART
scarred I-ART
and I-ART
heavy I-ART
. O
It O
is O
surrounded O
by O
a O
swarm B-ART
of O
small O
, O
brightly B-ART
colored I-ART
fish I-ART
. O


The O
spider B-ART
crab I-ART
holds O
you O
in O
three O
of O
its O
legs B-ART
. O
They O
circle O
your O
abdomen O
, O
chest O
, O
and O
knees O
. O
The O
spurs O
on O
the O
crab's B-ART
legs B-ART
press O
into O
you O
painfully O
. O
Through O
the O
great O
limbs O
, O
you O
feel O
a O
gentle O
, O
rhythmic O
vibration O
, O
as O
of O
a O
slow O
hearbeat O
. O


It O
is O
very O
noisy O
here O
, O
because O
of O
all O
the O
sheep B-ART
bleating O
. O
Near O
the O
corner B-ART
of O
the O
field B-ART
, O
a O
sign B-ART
points O
south O
down O
a O
track B-ART
. O


A O
long O
, O
winding O
track B-ART
ends O
here O
and O
a O
stile B-ART
continues O
east O
into O
a O
field B-ART
. O
A O
shortcut B-ART
to O
the O
farm O
leads O
back O
north B-ART
west I-ART
. O
In O
the O
field B-ART
you O
can O
see O
a O
large B-ART
, I-ART
fierce I-ART
bull I-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
track B-ART
leading O
west O
back O
to O
the O
farm O
, O
and O
east O
on O
to O
the O
creamery O

This O
is O
the O
track B-ART
leading O
north O
back O
to O
the O
farm O
, O
and O
east O
on O
to O
the O
creamery O
. O


You're O
standing O
on O
a O
gently O
sloping O
hill B-ART
near O
a O
popular O
Parisian O
park B-ART
. O
To O
the O
north O
you O
can O
see O
lots O
of O
people B-ART
enjoying O
the O
summer O
day O
. O
Those O
without O
parasols B-ART
sit O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
beautiful B-ART
green O
trees B-ART
, O
and O
in O
light O
of O
the O
way O
you're O
feeling O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
follow O
their O
lead O
. O
It's O
slightly O
after O
noon O
and O
the O
sun B-ART
is O
beating O
down O
on O
you O
. O


It's O
nice O
and O
shady O
here O
. O
An O
upper O
class O
Frenchwoman B-ART
and O
her O
male O
companion B-ART
complete O
with O
monocle B-ART
, O
top O
hat O
, O
and O
riding O
crop O
are O
standing O
here O
, O
staring O
off O
to O
the O
west O
. O
The O
river B-ART
does O
look O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
persistence O
of O
their O
gaze O
is O
unnerving O
. O
You O
can O
see O
a O
woman B-ART
knitting O
to O
the O
west O
and O
a O
girl O
holding O
a O
bouquet O
to O
the O
north O
. O


There's O
a O
girl B-ART
here O
, O
about O
thirteen B-ART
years O
old O
, O
arranging O
flowers B-ART
. O
There's O
a O
finished B-ART
bouquet I-ART
next O
to O
her O
, O
and O
her O
mother B-ART
or O
aunt O
, O
or O
whatever O
sits O
nearby O
, O
gazing O
at O
the O
Seine B-ART
. O
Exits O
are O
north O
, O
toward O
a O
little O
girl B-ART
and O
her O
mother B-ART
, O
south O
, O
where O
an O
aristocratic O
couple O
walk O
a O
pet O
monkey O
, O
and O
west O
, O
toward O
an O
open O
field O
. O


There's O
not O
much O
here O
besides O
grass O
. O
A O
nice O
view O
of O
the O
Seine B-ART
lies O
to O
your O
west O
. O
There's O
an O
obnoxious O
bugler B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
you O
don't O
like O
the O
idea O
of O
hearing O
his O
warbling O
tune O
at O
a O
higher O
volume O
. O
Thus O
, O
you O
can O
only O
go O
east O
or O
south O
from O
here O
. O


A O
woman B-ART
sits O
here O
knitting B-ART
a O
delicate O
white O
garment O
. O
She O
appears O
to O
be O
accompanied O
by O
a O
mustached O
man B-ART
with O
a O
top O
hat B-ART
and I-ART
cane I-ART
who O
looks O
across O
the O
river B-ART
. O
Nearby O
a O
boatman B-ART
smokes O
a O
pipe B-ART
and O
stares O
out B-ART
into O
the O
Seine B-ART
as O
well O
. O
An O
unoccupied O
grassy O
patch O
of O
land O
lies O
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
to O
the O
east O
you O
spot O
an O
aristocratic O
couple O
with O
a O
monkey O
. O


There's O
a O
little B-ART
girl I-ART
here O
, O
holding O
her O
mother's B-ART
hand O
. O
Other O
people B-ART
are O
to O
the O
north O
, O
but O
there's O
nothing O
interesting O
in O
that O
direction O
, O
so O
you O
can O
only O
return O
south O
from O
here O
. O


All O
that O
remains B-ART
of O
the O
bridge B-ART
is O
a O
few O
splintered B-ART
posts B-ART
and I-ART
planks I-ART
clinging O
sadly O
to O
both B-ART
banks I-ART
of O
the O
river B-ART
. O
The O
town B-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
, O
across B-ART
the O
river B-ART
. O


It O
starts O
to O
get O
marshy B-ART
here O
, O
but O
drier O
land O
is O
upstream O
to O
the O
west O
. O


The O
scrub B-ART
brush I-ART
along O
the O
river B-ART
is O
dense O
here O
, O
but O
it O
thins O
out B-ART
downstream O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
extremely O
well O
equipped O
control B-ART
room O
of O
your O
spaceship O
, O
which O
reflects O
the O
increase O
in O
your O
wealth O
following O
your O
last O
adventure O
. O
The O
only O
exit O
is O
north O
to O
the O
cargo O
hold O
. O
Your O
robot B-ART
dog I-ART
is O
sitting O
here O
. O
Petrov B-ART
, O
your O
navigator B-ART
, O
is O
standing O
alertly O
here O
. O
Dimi B-ART
, O
your O
engineer B-ART
, O
is O
here O
. O
Kara B-ART
, O
your O
second B-ART
in I-ART
command O
, O
is O
with O
you O
. O
Your O
console B-ART
area O
is O
to O
one O
side O
, O
apparently O
operating O
perfectly O
. O
The O
main O
control B-ART
button I-ART
awaits O
your O
use O
. O
Dimi B-ART
and I-ART
Kara I-ART
run O
into O
the O
cargo O
hold O
to O
check O
check O
out O
the O
engines O
. O
The O
dog B-ART
stands O
by O
, O
uncertain O
. O
Before O
you O
can O
react O
, O
the O
ship O
lurches O
suddenly O
as O
the O
ground O
moves O
beneath O
it O
. O
The O
control B-ART
room O
end O
tilts O
downwards O
, O
and O
the O
cargo O
hold O
end O
is O
thrown O
upwards O
. O
Dimi B-ART
is O
thrown O
backwards O
through O
the O
hatch B-ART
into O
the O
control B-ART
room O
, O
and O
the O
hatch B-ART
slams O
shut O
in O
a O
horrid O
jammed O
sort O
of O
way O
. O


An O
awful O
hammering O
and O
screaming O
comes O
from O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
hatch B-ART
! O


Well O
, O
it's O
private O
, O
at O
least O
. O
They O
assured O
you O
of O
this O
. O
It's O
a O
crumbly O
gray O
hole O
dug O
into O
a O
gray O
field B-ART
, O
yes O
, O
and O
the O
air's O
choked O
with O
dust B-ART
. O
You O
can't O
move O
without O
kicking O
up O
a O
new O
cloud B-ART
and O
blinding O
yourself B-ART
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
, O
not O
that O
there'd O
be O
much O
to O
miss O
. O
But O
at O
least O
people O
can't O
see O
you O
here O
. O
Even O
if O
someone O
down O
below O
were O
to O
look O
at O
the O
sky B-ART
when O
you O
were O
out B-ART
of O
your O
trench O
, O
they'd O
merely O
see O
a O
shiny O
speck O
. O
Windows O
get O
them O
all O
the O
time O
. O


They O
name O
everything O
up O
here O
like O
they O
would O
down O
below O
. O
So O
this O
area O
, O
silent O
and O
blank O
in O
all O
directions O
, O
they O
call O
a O
field O
, O
despite O
the O
lack O
of O
vegetation O
. O
There's O
nothing O
around O
under O
the O
horizon O
but O
gray O
dirt B-ART
, O
and O
flat O
sky B-ART
, O
and O
you O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
breaking O
the O
monotony O
is O
something O
raised B-ART
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
your O
crater B-ART
, O
a O
few O
steps O
away O
. O
Above O
you O
, O
stars B-ART
stand O
in O
their O
places O
, O
too O
far O
away O
to O
recognize O
; O
looming O
in O
front O
of O
them O
all O
is O
the O
earth B-ART
, O
almost O
close O
enough O
to O
touch O
. O
There's O
no O
coverage O
from O
it O
; O
anyone O
could O
see O
you O
from O
there O
, O
a O
shiny O
speck O
misplaced O
in O
the O
dust B-ART
. O


The O
field O
parts O
here O
, O
unexpectedly O
, O
to O
accommodate O
a O
small O
platform B-ART
. O
They O
call O
it O
a O
mesa B-ART
, O
the O
geographical O
term O
, O
but O
there's O
nothing O
natural O
about O
it O
. O
The O
slope O
leading O
up O
is O
too O
carved O
, O
too O
precise O
, O
and O
the O
edges O
are O
cut O
too O
well O
against O
the O
night O
sky B-ART
. O
It O
seems O
to O
repel O
everything O
; O
the O
dust B-ART
is O
gathered O
in O
a O
moat B-ART
around O
it O
, O
the O
craters O
leave O
a O
perimeter B-ART
, O
and O
even O
the O
stars B-ART
duck O
away O
from O
it O
. O
It's O
a O
clear O
jump O
, O
from O
there O
, O
up O
to O
the O
earth O
. O
Or O
so O
the O
others O
say O
. O
Your O
part O
of O
the O
moon O
continues O
a O
ways O
to O
the O
east O
. O


Calling O
this O
a O
crater O
would O
be O
generous O
. O
It's O
more O
of O
a O
pockmark O
in O
the O
ground O
, O
a O
blemish O
where O
rocks O
and O
sediment O
have O
settled O
into O
a O
thicker O
than O
usual O
pile O
of O
dust B-ART
. O
From O
here O
, O
you O
can O
peer O
over O
the O
walls O
to O
see O
a O
sliver O
of O
the O
surface O
. O


Joe's O
Bar B-ART
An O
undistinguished O
bar B-ART
, O
yet O
the O
social O
center O
of O
Upper O
Sandusky O
. O
The O
front O
door B-ART
is O
almost O
lost O
amidst O
the O
hazy O
maze O
of O
neon O
that O
shrouds O
the O
grimy O
glass B-ART
of O
the O
south O
wall O
. O
Doors B-ART
marked O
Ladies O
and O
Gents O
lead O
, O
respectively O
, O
northeast O
and O
northwest O
. O


Though O
operating O
at O
far O
below O
normal O
speed O
, O
your O
mind O
begins O
to O
conclude O
that O
it O
would O
be O
best O
at O
this O
point O
to O
find O
a O
bathroom B-ART
. O


Even O
if O
you O
don't O
care O
about O
your O
clothes B-ART
, O
imagine O
the O
embarrassment O
! O


You O
can't O
wait O
another O
second O
. O
Without O
going O
into O
embarrassing O
detail O
, O
you've O
made O
a O
mess O
. O
A O
moment O
later O
, O
before O
even O
half O
the O
people O
in O
Joe's B-ART
have O
begun O
tittering B-ART
, O
a O
flash O
of O
green O
light B-ART
precedes O
the O
arrival O
of O
two O
VERY O
odd O
patrons O
. O
They O
rotate O
their O
bellies O
to O
get O
a O
better O
look O
at O
you O
. O
As O
their O
mouth B-ART
stalks O
open O
you O
find O
that O
, O
despite O
an O
evolution O
that O
occurred O
dozens O
of O
astronomical O
units O
from O
Upper O
Sandusky O
, O
these O
fellows O
speak O
in O
perfect O
midwestern O
English O
. O
This O
one O
? O
A O
pitiful O
specimen O
. O
. O
. O
can't O
even O
control O
simple O
bodily O
functions O
. O
. O
. O
the O
tests O
would O
be O
worthless O
. O
. O
. O
Agreed O
. O
Must've O
been O
a O
screw O
up O
somewhere O
. O
Let's O
take O
this O
one O
instead O
. O
They O
grab O
a O
blonde O
woman B-ART
, O
whose O
scream O
is O
cut O
short O
by O
another O
green O
flash O
. O
Three O
weeks O
later O
, O
when O
the O
Earth B-ART
is O
invaded O
and O
everyone O
is O
enslaved O
by O
the O
Leather O
Goddesses O
of O
Phobos O
, O
you O
wonder O
if O
there O
was O
a O
connection O
. O


The O
forest B-ART
is O
beautiful O
in O
the O
fall O
, O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
be O
walking O
through O
it O
with O
you O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
was O
under O

The O
forest B-ART
is O
oddly O
silent O
. O
Your O
footsteps O
echo O
as O
you O
pace O
back O
and O
forth O
. O
I O
wonder O
where O
all O
the O

have O
gone O

Everyone's O
gone O
. O
The O
mess B-ART
from O
the O
funeral O
remains O

The O
narrow O
, O
dingy O
bathroom B-ART
of O
Scummett O
block O
is O
furnished O
with O
a O
bath B-ART
and O
a O
toilet B-ART

The O
wallpaper B-ART
peels O
miserably O
, O
as O
though O
? O
knowing O
from O
the O
first O
that O
it O
was O
doomed O
to O
languish O
in O
a O
humid O
cesspit O
? O
it O
could O
never O
quite O
summon O
the O
motivation O
to O
stand O
upright O
. O
The O
stippled B-ART
glass I-ART
on O
this O
shady O
side O
of O
the O
building O
admits O
little O
light O
, O
but O
the O
door B-ART
leading O
south O
into O
the O
corridor O
is O
outlined B-ART
in O
faint O
brightness O
. O


This O
is O
the O
west O
end O
of O
a O
carpeted B-ART
corridor O
providing O
access O
to O
all O
of O
the O
rooms O
in O
Scummett O

Most O
of O

are O
poky O

the O
two O

The O
corridor O
continues O
to O

A O
door B-ART

outside B-ART

This O
is O
the O
east O
end O
of O
Scummett O
block O
, O
where O
the O
otherwise O
featureless O
creamy O
torso O
of O
the O

, O
navel O

Back O

off O

The O

The O
mounds B-ART
of O

encrusted B-ART

Scummett O

lend O
a O
whole O
new O

to O
the O

are O
probably O
responsible O

the O

You O
are O
at O
the O

a O

to O
the O
south O

This O
corner O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
get O
cleaned O
often O

There O
is O
a O
rather O
large O
spider B-ART
web I-ART
stretched O
between O
the O
foot O
of O
the O

the O

Thankfully O
its O
inhabitant B-ART
is O
nowhere O
to O

. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O

southwest O

This O
is O
the O
dormitory O
room O
you O
share O
with O
your O
three O
closest O
friends O

There O
is O
a O
bed B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
a O
wardrobe B-ART
to O
the O
east O
, O
a O
bookshelf B-ART

a O
food B-ART

You O
can O
see O
sunlight B-ART
above O
you O
. O
The O
rest O
of O

There O
is O
a O
mouse O

in O
the O
southeast O
corner O
of O
the O

next O

the O

We O
dance O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
cave B-ART
, O
tumbling O
and O
falling O
over O
ourselves B-ART
. O
We O
are O
excited O
; O
our O
light B-ART
bounces O
from O
the O
ceiling B-ART
and I-ART
ground I-ART
, O
making O
the O
shadows B-ART
spin O
. O
Occasionally O
, O
we O
are O
so O
excited O
that O
a O
few O
of O
us O
fall O
out B-ART
the O
hole B-ART
to O
the O
west O
and O
are O
scattered O
. O
It's O
not O
like O
that O
in O
the O
rocks B-ART
, O
but O
we O
can O
afford O
to O
suffer O
for O
a O
little O
while O
. O


She O
hunkers O
in O
our O
cave B-ART
, O
fouling O
it O
. O
She O
has O
torn O
the O
hole B-ART
to O
the O
west O
to O
twice O
its O
size O
. O
She O
is O
strong O
. O


Cool O
and O
dark O
. O
We O
like O
the O
surface B-ART
, O
but O
we O
still O
enjoy O
the O
crust B-ART
during O
the O
hottest O
part O
of O
the O
day O
. O
The O
sun O
can O
be O
cruel O
sometimes O
, O
but O
we O
would O
miss O
it O
were O
we O
to O
live O
here O
. O


It O
is O
warm O
here O
a O
dull B-ART
red I-ART
glow I-ART
surrounds O
us O
. O
The O
rocks B-ART
drift O
slowly O
and O
soothe O
us O
with O
their O
gentle O
rhythm O
. O


We O
are O
hollow O
here O
we O
enclose O
a O
pocket B-ART
. O
But O
the O
ground B-ART
is O
solid O
as O
it O
rolls O
up O
into O
the O
hill B-ART
to O
the O
east O
and O
towards O
her O
to O
the O
west O
. O
Air B-ART
rolls O
against O
us O
from O
below O
. O


From O
here O
we O
can O
see O
everything O
. O
It O
is O
horrible O
. O
The O
ground B-ART
is O
ripped O
apart O
. O
The O
flat B-ART
spots I-ART
where O
we O
would O
bathe O
in O
the O
sun B-ART
are O
jagged O
and O
split O
. O
The O
pools B-ART
are O
fouled O
with O
her O
poison B-ART
. O
All O
around O
us O
, O
from O
hill B-ART
to O
horizon B-ART
, O
are O
signs O
of O
her O
presence O
. O
We O
should O
have O
not O
let O
her O
get O
this O
far O
. O
But O
we O
were O
scared O
. O
We O
had O
hoped O
she O
would O
leave O
on O
her O
own O
, O
but O
she O
is O
relentless O
. O


We O
remember O
this O
place O
. O
Here O
, O
and O
in O
the O
countless O
other O
pockets B-ART
beneath O
the O
surface B-ART
, O
we O
used O
to O
dance O
. O
The O
caves O
were O
always O
a O
little O
dangerous O
with O
stray O
drafts B-ART
spinning O
in O
to O
scatter O
us O
. O
Here O
the O
air B-ART
is O
dense O
it O
strains O
against O
the O
pocket B-ART
. O
It O
is O
not O
like O
the O
surface B-ART
air I-ART
. O
This O
air B-ART
is O
yellow B-ART
. O


You O
find O
yourself O
on O
the O
broad O
landing B-ART
, O
halfway O
up O
the O
staircase B-ART

The O
expanse O
of O
plain O
oak B-ART
panelling I-ART

relieved O
only O
by O
one O

The O
main O
stairs B-ART
swoop O
down O
to O
the O
hall O
, O
there O
are O
rooms B-ART
to O
the O
east O
and O
southeast O
, O
and O
a O
corridor O
bends O
round O
to O
the O
northeast O
. O
The O
rather O
shabby B-ART
strip I-ART
of I-ART
carpet I-ART
leads O
west O
to O
the O
gallery O
. O


The O
long O
narrow O
gallery B-ART
has O
railings B-ART
on O
one O
side O
and O
overlooks O
the O
hall B-ART
below O
. O
The O
length O
of O
the O
other O
wall B-ART
is O
hung O
with O
portraits B-ART
in O
oils B-ART
of O
your O
illustrious O
forebears O
. O
The O
stairs O
are O
to O
the O
east O

in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
the O
gallery B-ART
forks O
northwest O

Ah O
, O
the O
memories O
. O
Mama O
didn't O
think O
the O
village O
school B-ART
good O
enough O
for O
you O
, O
so O
instead O
employed O
a O
succession O
of O
private O
tutors O
. O
The O
hours O
you've O
spent O
here O
embroiled O
in O
your O
studies O
, O
trying O
to O
make O
sense O
of O
the O
writing B-ART
on O
the O
blackboard B-ART
, O
when O
you'd O
rather O
be O
playing O
games O
in O
your O
bedroom O
to O
the O

or O
even O
playing O
tunes O
in O

is O
about O
as O
far O
away O
from O
the O
Priory's O
living O
quarters O
as O
could O

You O
need O
stoop O
only O
slightly O
to O

is O
large O

A O
moment O
later O
, O
before B-ART
even O
half O
the O
people O
in O

have O
begun O
tittering O
, O
a O
flash B-ART

precedes O
the O
arrival O
of O
two O
VERY O
odd O
creatures O
. O


As O
their O

stalks O
begin O
moving O
you O
find O
that O
, O
despite O
an O
evolution O
that O
occured O
dozens O
of O
astronomical O
units O
from B-ART
Upper O

these O

You O
are O
too O
anxious O

You O
cannot O
do O
anything O
except O
wait O
it O
out B-ART

The O
interior O
of O
the O
lifeboat O
is O
rather O
cramped O
with O
the O
canvas O
cover O
on O
it O

but O
it O
was O
the O
only O
place O
you O
could O
find O
to O
stow O
away O
on O
board O
the O
Lily O

A O
wisp O
of O
bitterly O
cold O
wind O
enters O
through O
the O
flap O
of O
canvas O
you O
detached O
to O
crawl O
inside O
. O
By O
exiting O
the O
same O
way O
, O
you O
can O
climb O
onto O
the O
deck O
of O
the O
ship B-ART

The O
aft O
deck O
rumbles O
with O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
engine B-ART
below O
it O
, O
and O
water O
churns O
out O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O

the O
unceasing O
northern O

howl O
around O

Clinging O
to O
the O

you O
can O
feel O
the O

Its O

as O
if O

the O
the O

It O

eerie O
here O

To O

The O

of O

fairly O

severely O
delapidated O

A O

This O
, O
you O
surmise O
, O
is O
the O
final O
form O
of O
the O
avalanche B-ART
that O
got O
you O
here O
a O
chaotic O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
rocks I-ART
. O
The O
pile B-ART
is O
so O
huge O
that O
you O
wonder O
at O
your O
survival O
. O
One O
man O
against O
all O
that O
rock B-ART
? O
He O
lived O
? O
Wherever O
the O
rocks B-ART
are O
not O
, O
the O
mountain B-ART
is O
, O
except O
for O
a O
small O
corridor O
of O
sheer O
stone O
leading O
south O
at O
least O
you O
think O
it's O
south O
. O


This O
area O
is O
the O
exact O
opposite O
of O
one O
of O
those O
clearings O
that O
every O
lost O
traveler O
always O
finds O
themselves O
in O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
borders O
on O
oppressive O
. O
The O
sheer O
mountain B-ART
cliffs O
end O
abruptly O
at O
and O
are O
ended O
abrutply O
at O
by O
a O
dense O
forest B-ART
of O
tall O
evergreens B-ART
. O
The O
roar O
of O
water O
from O
the O
west O
adds O
to O
the O
feeling O
of O
claustrophobia O
and O
tenseness O
. O
One O
tree O
has O
fallen O
over O
to O
the O
northeast O
, O
creating O
a O
sort O
of O
path O
in O
that O
direction O
, O
and O
the O
rock B-ART
corridor O
, O
a O
jarring O
gap O
in O
the O
otherwise O
unchanging O
mountain B-ART
, O
leads O
north O
. O
In O
all O
other O
directions O
the O
forest B-ART
is O
too O
dense O
to O
see O
through O
, O
although O
you O
could O
possibly O
walk O
among O
the O
trees B-ART
. O


The O
tree O
, O
fallen O
from O
the O
southwest O
, O
ends O
just O
short O
of O
an O
almost O
vertical O
rock B-ART
face I-ART
, O
apparently O
granite O
. O
The O
mountain B-ART
curves O
menacingly O
all O
around O
, O
cutting O
off O
travel O
in O
other O
directions O
. O


This O
area O
seems O
to O
be O
filled O
with O
abrupt O
ends O
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
the O
mountain B-ART
ends O
abruptly O
at O
the O
forest O
you O
came O
from O
, O
and O
vice O
versa O
. O
The O
forest O
also O
ends O
abruptly O
at O
the O
cliff O
which O
you O
are O
standing O
on O
. O
It's O
about O
ten O
feet O
wide O
and O
ends O
abruptly O
in O
midair O
. O
Far O
above O
, O
a O
riverbed O
abruptly O
ends O
at O
the O
abrupt O
end O
of O
the O
mountain B-ART
, O
generating O
an O
incredibly O
long O
but O
relatively O
narrow O
waterfall B-ART
. O
From O
the O
roar O
that O
emanates O
from O
below O
, O
you O
presume O
that O
this O
waterfall B-ART
ends O
abruptly O
at O
some O
flat O
surface O
, O
creating O
high O
intensity O
sound O
waves O
which O
end O
abruptly O
at O
your O
ears O
, O
which O
end O
abruptly O
at O
the O
side O
of O
your O
head O
, O
which O
ends O
abrutply O
at O
your O
shoulders O
, O
and O
so O
on O
and O
so O
forth O
. O


Inside O
a O
fence B-ART
which O
seems O
inadequate O
, O
a O
chaotic O
collection O
of O
farm O
animals B-ART
mills O
about O
. O
Two O
fat O
pigs B-ART
are O
lying O
happily O
in O
a O
mudhole O
in O
one O
corner O
of O
the O
pen B-ART
. O
Hens B-ART
seem O
to O
be O
everywhere O
; O
the O
rooster B-ART
can't O
keep O
track O
of O
them O
any O
more O
than O
you O
can O
he O
hurries O
around O
, O
croaking O
at O
them O
haphazardly O
. O
A O
few O
cows B-ART
stand O
off O
to O
one O
side O
, O
mooing O
in O
irritation O
when O
bothered B-ART
by O
any O
of O
the O
other O
animals B-ART
. O
A O
small O
dog B-ART
with O
mottled O
, O
shaggy O
fur O
barks O
now O
and O
then O
. O
Three O
or O
four O
sheep B-ART
are O
huddled O
together O
in O
a O
corner O
, O
baa O
ing O
. O
A O
tall O
gray O
horse B-ART
moves O
anxiously O
here O
and O
there O
, O
obviously O
disturbed O
by O
this O
noisy O
crowd O
. O
You O
don't O
blame O
him B-ART
the O
garden O
to O
the O
east O
looks O
so O
nice O
and O
quiet O
. O
To O
the O
northeast O
is O
the O
forest O
, O
and O
to O
the O
west O
is O
another O
bunch O
of O
trees O
but O
they O
look O
like O
fruit O
trees O
. O


You O
emerge O
from O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
corral O
into O
the O
blissful O
quiet O
of O
an O
exquisite O
orchard B-ART
. O
Trees B-ART
of O
countless O
varieties O
stand O
in O
neat O
, O
even O
rows O
. O
Oddly O
, O
however O
, O
trees B-ART
of O
the O
same O
species O
are O
not O
adjacent O
to O
one O
another O
. O
The O
pear B-ART
trees I-ART
, O
for O
example O
, O
seem O
to O
be O
scattered O
at O
random O
. O
Although O
the O
orchard B-ART
does O
not O
occupy O
much O
ground O
, O
the O
trees B-ART
all O
appear O
laden O
with O
fruit B-ART
surely O
they O
can't O
ALL O
be O
in O
season O
? O


The O
density O
of O
the O
forest O
lessens O
as O
it O
goes O
south O
, O
and O
the O
trees O
finally O
disappear O
here O
, O
where O
a O
ramshackle O
fence B-ART
encloses O
a O
square O
patch O
of O
ground O
on O
which O
grow O
various O
vegetables B-ART
. O
Tiny O
cornstalks B-ART
are O
beginning O
to O
sprout O
, O
and O
there O
are O
rows O
of O
little O
carrot B-ART
tops I-ART
. O
Poles B-ART
and I-ART
wicker I-ART
lattices I-ART
set O
into O
the O
earth O
indicate O
that O
beans O
and O
tomatoes O
are O
expected O
. O
The O
garden B-ART
adjoins O
an O
old O
log B-ART
cabin I-ART
, O
of O
which O
you O
seem O
to O
be O
facing O
the O
backside B-ART
. O
A O
path O
leads O
south O
around O
the O
side O
of O
the O
building O
, O
and O
it O
looks O
as O
though O
you O
could O
enter O
by O
the O
back B-ART
door I-ART
. O


You O
are O
facing O
the O
front O
of O
the O
log B-ART
cabin I-ART
. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
wilderness O
around O
it O
, O
it O
is O
built O
perfectly O
square O
; O
it O
seems O
almost O
out O
of O
place O
, O
as O
though O
it O
was O
assembled O
somewhere O
else O
and O
then O
inserted O
into O
this O
scene O
. O
In O
the O
exact O
center O
of O
the O
front O
wall B-ART
is O
a O
door B-ART
. O
A O
massive O
tree O
stands O
similarly O
alone O
to O
the O
southwest O
. O
Around O
the O
side O
of O
the O
cabin B-ART
, O
a O
path O
heads O
north O
; O
a O
smaller O
path O
, O
heading O
east O
, O
branches O
off O
of O
it O
. O
Some O
way O
off O
to O
the O
south O
you O
can O
see O
a O
wall B-ART
, O
and O
then O
the O
land O
appears O
to O
end O
. O


The O
kitchen B-ART
is O
small O
but O
seems O
functional O
. O
A O
tall O
cupboard B-ART
occupies O
one O
corner O
, O
flanked O
by O
a O
refrigerator B-ART
and O
a O
gas O
stove O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
room B-ART
is O
occupied O
by O
a O
fair B-ART
sized I-ART
wooden B-ART
table I-ART
. O
A O
hallway O
leads O
west O
, O
and O
the O
back O
door O
leads O
out O
. O


This O
area O
is O
barren O
. O
The O
few O
small O
shrubs O
which O
do O
grow O
lean O
toward O
the O
mountain O
in O
terror O
, O
blown O
relentlessly O
by O
the O
wind O
from O
over O
the O
nearby O
cliff O
. O
In O
blatant O
exception O
to O
this O
is O
one O
monumental B-ART
tree B-ART
, O
a O
redwood B-ART
. O
It O
is O
almost O
2 O
meters O
in O
diameter O
, O
and O
could O
easily O
be O
100 O
meters O
tall O
. O
You O
must O
crane O
your O
neck O
painfully O
to O
look O
at O
its O
peak O
, O
and O
when O
you O
do O
, O
you O
see O
that O
most O
of O
its O
branches O
are O
as O
thick O
as O
your O
torso O
. O
Then O
, O
in O
another O
blatant O
denial O
of O
what O
was O
said O
before O
, O
the O
magnificence O
of O
the O
tree B-ART
is O
overshadowed O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
is O
has O
been O
hollowed B-ART
out O
. O
A O
huge B-ART
, I-ART
door I-ART
like O
hole B-ART
faces O
north O
, O
toward O
the O
mountain O
, O
and O
apparently O
is O
the O
entrance O
into O
a O
veritable O
room B-ART
within O
the O
tree B-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
you O
can O
see O
an O
awesome O
precipice O
, O
but O
jagged O
rocks O
make O
it O
impossible O
to O
reach O
from O
where O
you O
are O
now O
. O


The O
space O
within O
the O
tree B-ART
is O
small O
in O
floor O
area O
, O
but O
seems O
very O
large O
because O
the O
ceiling B-ART
is O
so O
high O
; O
the O
hollow B-ART
part O
of O
the O
tree B-ART
extends O
upwards O
for O
four O
or O
five O
meters O
. O
As O
you O
soon O
as O
you O
turn O
your O
attention O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
however O
, O
reality O
sets O
in O
there O
is O
barely O
enough O
room B-ART
for O
you O
to O
lie O
down O
. O


Only O
the O
best O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
the O
main O
room O
of O
the O
Secret O
Service O
headquarters O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
oak O
panelled O
, O
and O
covered O
with O
photographs O
of O
important O
looking O
people O
; O
the O
floor O
sparkles O
so O
much O
that O
you O
suspect O
it O
has O
been O
enhanced O
with O
the O
aid O
of O
a O
spell O
; O
and O
the O
equipment O
is O
all O
top O
of O
the O
range O
, O
including O
the O
Magic O
Weaver O
in O
the O
corner O
. O


The O
lush B-ART
green I-ART
grass I-ART
of O
this O
large O
field B-ART
makes O
it O
perfect O
for O
keeping O
sheep B-ART
. O
They O
graze O
all O
day O
, O
but O
the O
grass B-ART
never O
seems O
to O
thin O
. O
Through O
the O
thick B-ART
hedgrerows O
to O
the O
west O
lies O
another O
of O
your O
fields B-ART
and O
a O
track B-ART
winds I-ART
north O
towards O
Bethlehem O
. O


You O
don't O
use O
this O
field B-ART
as O
much O
as O
the O
one O
to O
the O
east O
. O
Without O
the O
attention O
from O
your O
herd B-ART
, O
the O
grass B-ART
has O
grown O
very O
long O
; O
it O
now O
extends O
to O
your O
knees B-ART
. O
A O
gnarly B-ART
old I-ART
tree I-ART
stands O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
field B-ART
, O
surrounded O
by O
mulberry B-ART
bushes I-ART
. O
The O
sweeping B-ART
hedgerows I-ART
break O
to O
the O
southwest O
and O
southeast O
, O
and O
you O
can O
just O
make O
out B-ART
your O
herd B-ART
grazing O
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
tree B-ART
, O
while O
old B-ART
and O
creaking O
, O
stands O
tall O
and O
proud O
amongst O
your O
fields B-ART
. O
You O
haven't O
climbed O
it O
in O
years O
, O
but O
your O
feet B-ART
follow O
the O
dry O
branches B-ART
perfectly O
. O


Daisies B-ART
cover O
the O
ground B-ART
of O
this O
field B-ART
, O
replacing O
the O
grass O
completely O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
you O
see O
nothing O
but O
daisies B-ART
, O
except O
to O
the O
northeast O
, O
southeast O
and O
east O
, O
where O
the O
hedgerows B-ART
part O
. O
How O
peculiar B-ART
. O


This O
field B-ART
marks O
the O
edge B-ART
of O
your O
land B-ART
, O
and O
you O
don't O
frequent O
it O
often O
; O
the O
coarse B-ART
grass I-ART
underfoot O
exemplifies O
the O
tough B-ART
nature I-ART
of O
the O
terrain B-ART
. O
Before O
you O
lie O
three O
bushes B-ART
, O
beaten O
into O
strange B-ART
shapes I-ART
by O
the O
prevailing B-ART
easterly B-ART
wind I-ART
hawthorn B-ART
on O
the O
left B-ART
, I-ART
rosemary I-ART
in O
the O
centre B-ART
and I-ART
juniper I-ART
on O
the O
far O
right B-ART
. O


Everyone's O
out B-ART
to O
enjoy O
the O
weather O
today O
. O
Beneath O
an O
oddly O
shimmering O
sky B-ART
, I-ART
children I-ART
play O
on O
swing B-ART
sets I-ART
, I-ART
couples I-ART
chat O
at O
picnic B-ART
tables I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
folks I-ART
in O
patriotic B-ART
jumpsuits I-ART
gaze O
up O
at O
a O
giant B-ART
flagpole I-ART
. O
A O
footpath O
leads O
north O
to O
a O
cluster O
of O
buildings O
. O


This O
shed O
is O
packed O
with O
bicycles B-ART
, I-ART
boxes I-ART
, O
brooms B-ART
, O
and O
other O
B O
items B-ART
. O
There O
are O
even O
a O
few O
umbrellas B-ART
kind O
of O
a O
stretch O
, O
you O
think O
. O


You O
are O
walking O
along O
a O
dusty B-ART
path B-ART
. O
It O
continues O
to O
the O
north O
but O
, O
for O
some O
reason O
, O
doesn't O
go O
in O
any O
other O
direction O
. O


You O
appear O
to O
be O
on O
the O
same O
path B-ART
as O
before O
. O
In O
the O
distance O
, O
the O
lights O
of O
a O
small O
town O
flicker O
dimly O
. O


This O
town B-ART
appears O
really O
to O
only O
consist O
of O
one O
building O
. O
It O
is O
to O
your O
east O
. O
The O
path O
continues O
north O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
at O
a O
turn O
in O
the O
path B-ART
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
you O
see O
some O
kind O
of O
building O
. O
Unlike O
the O
other O
paths B-ART
, O
this O
one O
continues O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
appears O
to O
the O
funkey's B-ART
farm B-ART
. O
Apricots B-ART
litter O
the O
floor O
. O


This O
tavern O
appears O
to O
have O
no O
custom O
other O
than O
a O
short O
man B-ART
in O
a O
striped B-ART
jumper I-ART
sitting O
in O
the O
corner O
. O
This O
is O
in O
part O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
sell O
no O
beer B-ART
; O
a O
sign B-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART
proclaims O
Swiggles' B-ART
The O
bar B-ART
that's O
fit O
for O
and O
run O
by O
a O
puritastard B-ART
. O
. O


Very O
warm O
, O
breathing O
is O
a O
malicious O
task O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
a O
dynamic O
gray O
, O
changing O
tones O
and O
moods O
, O
some O
casting O
light O
and O
others O
darkness O
. O
The O
heat O
rises O
from O
the O
floor O
, O
a O
rocky O
slab O
of O
some O
sort O
, O
dotted O
with O
bits O
of O
rag B-ART
and O
whatever O
clings O
to O
them O
. O
The O
ceiling B-ART
is O
high O
, O
unreachable O
, O
a O
static O
gray O
of O
equal O
parts O
. O
Featuring O
no O
sharp O
corners O
, O
the O
room O
bottlenecks O
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
walls B-ART
splinter O
off O
into O
both B-ART
northeast O
and O
southeast O
retreats O
. O
To O
the O
west O
lies O
the O
Oven O
. O


As O
you O
enter O
this O
room O
, O
the O
floor O
seems O
to O
disappear O
, O
as O
do O
the O
walls B-ART
and I-ART
ceiling I-ART
. O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
you O
are O
floating O
, O
though O
you O
can O
feel O
the O
floor O
. O
You O
try O
to O
focus O
on O
anything O
, O
but O
it's O
all O
the O
same O
and O
all O
as O
vast O
. O
Is O
there O
even O
light O
in O
this O
room O
? O
Your O
own O
body O
seems O
to O
be O
cloaked O
from O
your O
site O
, O
yet O
there O
is O
no O
definite O
darkness O
. O
Hopefully O
, O
you O
can O
find O
your O
way O
back O
out O
. O


The O
room's O
loan O
feature O
is O
a O
big O
door B-ART
on O
the O
eastern O
wall B-ART
, O
which O
is O
frantically O
, O
but O
silently O
, O
moving O
. O
Seems O
like O
something O
is O
in O
it O
. O


You O
find O
yourself O
chained B-ART
to O
a O
throne B-ART
of I-ART
gold I-ART
and I-ART
alabaster I-ART
, O
strapped O
onto O
the O
back O
of O
a O
huge O
birdlike B-ART
creature I-ART
, O
covered O
in O
a O
ridiculously O
garish O
plumage B-ART
of O
oddly O
nuanced O
feathers B-ART
which O
occasionally O
whips O
around O
as O
a O
burst O
of O
wind B-ART
gets O
too O
close O
. O
Yep O
, O
that's O
right O
. O
You're O
flying O
. O
Close O
to O
the O
limit O
of O
sound O
. O

Twenty O
minutes O
late O
to O
your O

working O
at O
the O
Planetron O

. O
You O
usually O
aren't O
late O
for O
anything O
, O
but O
for O
some O
reason O
you O
found O
this O
place O
to O
be O
further O
than O
you O
expected O
. O
After O
passing O
through O

you O
quickly O

A O

with O
a O

on O
one O
side O
and O
waiting O
chairs B-ART
on O
the O
other O
. O
Behind O
the O

you O
could O
see O
a O
clock B-ART
, O
filing O
cabinets O
, O
and O
all O
the O
things O
you O
would O
usually O
find O
behind O
a O
front O
desk B-ART

A O
hallway O
next O

the O

, O
while O
the O
glass B-ART

There O
is O
something O
about O
Madam B-ART
Spider's I-ART
parlor B-ART
that O
is O
both B-ART
banal O
and O
unsettling O
. O
The O
ornately O
patterned O
wallpaper B-ART
seems O
to O
press O
in O
from O
every O
direction O
. O
Heavy B-ART
red I-ART
drapes I-ART
block O
the O
only O
window B-ART
in O
the O
room O
, O
adding O
to O
the O
sense O
of O
claustrophobia O
. O
A O
black B-ART
divan I-ART
sits O
in O
one O
corner O
, O
not O
far O
from O
Madam B-ART
Spider's I-ART
rocking B-ART
chair I-ART
, O
where O
the O
giant B-ART
arachnid I-ART
is O
busy O
with O
her O
knitting B-ART
. O


The O
paneled B-ART
music I-ART
room I-ART
may O
once O
have O
been O
full O
of O
song O
and O
laughter O
for O
some O
reason O
you O
do O
not O
doubt O
this O
, O
but O
now O
everything B-ART
is O
quiet O
, O
still O
. O
Even O
the O
air B-ART
around O
you O
carries B-ART
a O
certain O
staleness O
. O


The O
slate B-ART
gray I-ART
dining I-ART
room I-ART
, O
though O
gaudily B-ART
decorated O
, O
is O
devoid O
of O
any O
sense O
of O
warmth O
. O
A O
long O
marble B-ART
top I-ART
table I-ART
takes O
up O
most O
of O
the O
space O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
which O
is O
occupied O
by O
a O
Chippendale B-ART
style B-ART
china I-ART
cabinet I-ART
. O
The O
faux B-ART
flames I-ART
of O
the O
chandelier B-ART
overhead O
are O
reflected O
in O
the O
window B-ART
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
table B-ART
. O


An O
amber B-ART
glass I-ART
sconce I-ART
throws O
a O
warm O
glow O
over O
the O
landing B-ART
at O
the O
top B-ART
of O
the O
stairs B-ART
. O
Straight O
ahead O
, O
you O
see O
a O
pair B-ART
of I-ART
bifold I-ART
closet I-ART
doors I-ART
, O
and O
to O
the O
east O
, O
a O
beautiful O
hand B-ART
carved I-ART
door I-ART
of I-ART
black I-ART
walnut I-ART
. O


The O
wallpaper B-ART
lined O
hallway B-ART
comes O
to O
an O
L O
here O
, O
with O
passages O
continuing O
to O
the O
east O
and O
south O
. O
To O
the O
west O
, O
you O
see O
a O
simple B-ART
wooden I-ART
door I-ART
. O


This O
is O
where O
the O
hallway B-ART
from O
the O
north O
comes O
to O
a O
dead B-ART
end I-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
rail B-ART
overlooking O
the O
stairway B-ART
to O
the O
east O
. O
To O
the O
west O
, O
a O
long B-ART
flannel I-ART
curtain I-ART
marks O
the O
entrance O
to O
another O
room O
. O


This O
room B-ART
was O
once O
occupied O
by O
children B-ART
ostensibly O
Madam O
Spider's B-ART
children B-ART
. O
If O
you O
couldn't O
tell O
from O
the O
metal B-ART
frame I-ART
bunk I-ART
bed O
, O
the O
enormous B-ART
cartoon I-ART
spider I-ART
painted O
on O
the O
wall B-ART
would've O
given O
it O
away O
. O
Years O
ago O
, O
this O
may O
have O
been O
a O
cheerful O
place O
, O
but O
now O
it O
is O
desolate O
. O
The O
beds B-ART
are O
stripped O
and O
clumps B-ART
of I-ART
dust I-ART
have O
collected O
in O
the O
corners B-ART
. O
An O
undressed B-ART
window I-ART
offers O
a O
view B-ART
of O
the O
equally O
barren B-ART
night I-ART
sky I-ART
. O


Who O
knows O
what O
might O
be O
hidden O
in O
the O
dark O
rafters O
and O
shadowy O
corners O
of O
this O
emporium B-ART
? O


The O
light B-ART
takes O
shape O
, O
the O
shape O
of O
so O
many O
broad O
steps B-ART
your O
eyes O
swim O
. O
You O
can't O
see O
the O
edges O
of O
the O
steps B-ART
to O
left O
and O
right O
where O
they O
taper O
into O
the O
distance O
, O
and O
the O
top O
and O
bottom O
of O
the O
flight B-ART
also O
melt O
into O
the O
shining B-ART
. O
The O
golden B-ART
stone I-ART
they're O
hewn O
from O
seems O
hard O
enough O
to O
be O
eternal O
, O
soft O
enough O
to O
sink O
into O
. O
The O
air B-ART
is O
sumptuously O
cool O
, O
sweet O
. O


You O
see O
mortals B-ART
, O
sad O
lost B-ART
things O
, O
in O
their O
multitudes O
. O
They O
never O
stop O
their O
scurrying O
, O
killing O
and O
dying O
. O
Their O
acrid O
, O
gangrenous O
smells O
rise O
almost O
to O
your O
nostrils O
, O
and O
the O
smokes B-ART
and I-ART
fires I-ART
of O
their O
lusts O
burn O
everywhere O
, O
clogging O
the O
universe O
with O
ash B-ART
. O

is O
an O

The O

Running O

a O
wall B-ART
as O
high O

your O

perhaps O

to O

You O
lie O
still O
against O
the O

that O
runs O
from O

savoring O
the O

you O

Can't O
remain O

this O

Back O

it's O
no O

it's O
a O
trap O

it O
goes O
only O
up O

The O

The O

running O
along O

Not O
a O

a O

stands O
easily O
here O

The O

which O
stretches O

Immediately O

the O

The O
storehouse O

lined O
on O
both B-ART

heavy O
steel O
shelves B-ART

the O
sort O
intended O
to O
handle O
the O
inventory O
of O
a O
20th O
century O

You O
should O
know O
, O
because O
that's O
where O
you O
got O
them O
from O

These O
shelves B-ART

themselves O

In O
the O
center O
of O
this O
area O
stands O
the O
Planar B-ART

an O
unimpressive O
affair O
that O
looks O
not O

a O
large O
open O

made O
of O

You O
take O
in O
rather O
perfunctorily O
the O
objects O
of O
your O
daily O
life O
the O
tripod B-ART
, O
the O
yellowed B-ART

you O

Dark O
stained B-ART
oak I-ART
paneling I-ART
with O
well O
polished B-ART
brass I-ART
knobs I-ART

attempt O
to O
give O
this O
smoky O
room B-ART
a O
dignity O
it O
doesn't O
deserve O

Rich O
detailing O
aside O
, O
this O
is O
the O
doorstep B-ART
to O
depravity O
, O
and O
the O
less O

spend O
here O
, O
the O
better O

For O
those O
who O
think O
otherwise O
, O
there O
is O
a O
plush B-ART
red I-ART
sofa I-ART
against O
the O

under O
a O

To O
the O

is O
an O

To O
the O

is O
a O
glass B-ART

The O
tall O

extends O
as O
far O
as O
you O
can O
see O

rippling O
slightly O
in O
the O

This O
relatively O
quiet O
stretch O
of O
South O
Main O
Street B-ART
houses O
several O
of O
the O

In O
front O
of O
you O
is O
the O
headquarters O
of O
the O
university's O
band O

, O
affectionately O
known O
as O
the O
Band O
Hall O

A O
huge O
mural B-ART
runs O
the O
entire O
length O
of O
the O
flat O
, O
stucco O
building O
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
Band O

, O
and O
to O
the O
south O
, O
further O
down O
the O

is O
the O

This O
is O
a O
small O
area O
with O
a O
low O
ceiling B-ART
, O
just O
off O
the O
side O
of O
the O
band O

To O

is O
the O

of O
Mr O

To O

the O
band O

This O
cramped O
area O
, O
just O
southwest O
of O
the O
main O
rehearsal O
hall O
, O
consists O
of O
a O
dirty O
old O
couch B-ART
situated O
in O
a O
corner O
. O
Often O
, O
one O
finds O
students O
stopping O
here O
to O
relax O
and O
chat O
between O
activities O
. O
It O
is O
adjacent O
to O
the O
band O
offices O
and O
the O
Cage O
. O
There O
are O
exits O
to O
the O
east O
, O
northeast O
, O
and O
west O
. O


The O
cage O
is O
an O
area O
located O
underneath O
one O
of O
the O
upstairs O
rooms O
. O
Instead O
of O
a O
wall B-ART
separating O
it O
from O
the O
main O
rehearsal O
room O
, O
there O
is O
a O
chain O
link O
fence O
. O
The O
door O
leading O
into O
the O
cage O
isn't O
a O
door O
at O
all O
, O
but O
a O
swinging O
chain O
link O
gate O
. O
What O
the O
building O
lacks O
in O
aesthetics O
, O
it O
makes O
up O
for O
in O
functionality O
. O
There O
are O
exits O
to O
the O
east O
, O
south O
, O
and O
west O
. O


This O
area O
is O
the O
part O
of O
the O
cage O
where O
music O
is O
copied O
for O
the O
band O
. O
A O
sophisticated O
color O
copier B-ART
sits O
against O
one O
wall B-ART
. O
There O
are O
exits O
to O
the O
west O
and O
north O
. O


There's O
not O
much O
inside O
this O
tiny O
closet O
except O
a O
small O
table B-ART
with O
a O
coffee B-ART
maker I-ART
and O
a O
few O
old O
programs B-ART
from O
past O
band O
concerts O
. O


This O
area O
is O
filled O
with O
rows O
and O
rows O
of O
file B-ART
cabinets I-ART
. O
They O
are O
full O
of O
thousands O
of O
pieces O
of O

This O
is O
Tim B-ART
Cranshaw's I-ART
office O
. O
Tim B-ART
is O
in O
charge O
of O
all O
the O
band's O
equipment O
and O
instruments B-ART
. O
His O
office O
is O
small O
and O
cluttered B-ART
with O
stacks O
of O
papers O
, O
pieces O
of O
musical O
instruments B-ART
, O
and O
other O
junk O
lying O
around O
. O
Tim's B-ART
desk B-ART
is O
probably O
the O
most O
cluttered B-ART
, O
messy O
desk B-ART
that O
you O
have O
ever O
seen O
. O
You O
wonder O
how O
he O
gets O
anything O
done O
in O
here O
. O


It O
has O
been O
said O
that O
if O
you O
wish O
to O
experience O
death O
, O
just O
spend O
time O
in O
a O
featureless O
white B-ART
room O
. O
Fortunately O
for O
you O
, O
this O
room O
features O
a O
door O
in O
the O
south O
wall O
to O
break O
up O
the O
monotony O
of O
its O
blank O
white B-ART
walls O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
the O
floor O
isn't O
solid O
white B-ART
but O
instead O
has O
a O
copper B-ART
colored I-ART
grid I-ART
embedded O
in O
it O
. O
The O
room O
is O
lit O
by O
soft O
, O
diffuse O
white B-ART
light O
which O
seems O
to O
emanate O
uniformly O
from O
the O
entire O
ceiling B-ART
. O


An O
elevator B-ART
; O
pretty O
much O
like O
any O
other O
elevator B-ART
you've O
ever O
been O
in O
. O
Your O
increased O
weight O
conveys O
the O
sensation O
of O
movement O
and O
the O
floor O
indicator B-ART
above O
the O
closed O
doors B-ART
changes O
as O
the O
elevator B-ART
passes O
floors O
. O
Next O
to O
the O
elevator B-ART
doors I-ART
, O
several O
dozen O
buttons B-ART
are O
arranged O
in O
two O
rows O
. O


Even O
with O
your O
eyes O
forced O
wide O
open O
all O
you O
can O
see O
is O
a O
dim O
yellow B-ART
haze I-ART
no O
pattern O
, O
no O
texture O
, O
no O
shapes O
. O
You O
are O
closely O
held O
on O
all O
sides O
by O
something B-ART
cool O
but O
gently O
yielding O
. O


This O
is O
where O
you O
live O
with O
your O
buddy O
Jim O
. O
His O
stuff B-ART
adorns O
every O
surface O
of O
the O
room O
. O
The O
front O
door B-ART
leads O
out B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


A O
formless O
place O
, O
such O
as O
you O
have O
often O
seen O
before O
; O
where O
dreams O
end O
and O
tasks O
begin O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
uneven O
, O
cupped O
like O
the O
palm O
of O
your O
master's O
hand O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
shimmer B-ART
with O
the O
artifice B-ART
of O
your O
sending O
. O


A O
narrow O
ledge O
of O
solid O
rock B-ART
at O
the O
southern O
end O
of O
a O
great O
cavern O
. O
Beyond O
it O
lies O
a O
body O
of O
water B-ART
so O
flat B-ART
, O
so O
black O
and O
tranquil O
, O
that O
it O
might O
be O
a O
surface O
of O
polished O
obsidian B-ART
. O


This O
is O
your O
home B-ART
. O
A O
small O
cottage B-ART
that O
you O
built O
for O
you O
and O
your O
daughter B-ART
. O
Made O
from O
the O
wood O
of O
the O
surrounding O
trees O
, O
it O
blends O
in O
very O
well O
with O
the O
surroundings O
. O
The O
room O
is O
not O
well O
furnished O
. O
There O
is O
just O
a O
table B-ART
, O
an O
old O
stove B-ART
and I-ART
two I-ART
beds I-ART
. O
In O
one O
of O
the O
beds B-ART
lies O
your O
daughter B-ART
, I-ART
Crystal I-ART
. O
Set O
in O
the O
south O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
cottage B-ART
is O
a O
small O
square O
window B-ART
. O


You O
stand O
in O
a O
small O
clearing O
in O
the O
wood O
. O
Just O
to O
your O
south O
you O
see O
a O
little B-ART
cottage B-ART
. O
It O
is O
totally O
silent O
here O
, O
even O
the O
birds O
have O
stopped O
singing O
. O
To O
the O
North O
is O
the O
East O
road O
. O


The O
road O
bends O
here O
, O
taking O
you O
either B-ART
north O
or O
east O
. O


The O
path B-ART
that O
you O
came O
in O
on O
stretches O
off O
to O
the O
north O
east O
, O
along O
with O
the O
lawn B-ART
. O
To O
the O
west O
is O
the O
start O
of O
the O
big B-ART
forest I-ART
, O
and O
to O
the O
south O
is O
the O
front O
porch B-ART
. O


The O
wooden O
overhang O
of O
the O
porch O
is O
handy O
for O
keeping O
the O
rain O
off O
, O
and O
in O
summer O
you O
could O
sit O
out B-ART
here O
on O
the O
rocker O
which O
seems O
to O
have O
disappeared O
and O
drink O
root O
beer O
. O
Steps O
to O
the O
north O
lead O
down O
to O
the O
yard O
, O
and O
the O
door B-ART
opens O
to O
the O
south O
. O


The O
entry O
hall O
is O
kind O
of O
cramped O
, O
even O
with O
everyone O
else O
gone O
. O
Stairs O
lead O
up O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
, O
and O
the O
hall O
itself O
leads O
south O
from O
the O
front O
door B-ART
to O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
and O
east O
and O
west O
to O
the O
library O
and O
kitchen O
. O


Uncle O
Oscar's O
library O
is O
small O
but O
the O
shelves B-ART
have O
a O
good O
selection O
of O
mystery B-ART
novels I-ART
, O
and O
the O
table B-ART
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
is O
nice O
to O
sit O
at O
and O
read O
them O
. O


Uncle O
Oscar's O
kitchen B-ART
is O
fairly O
simple O
some O
cupboards B-ART
, O
a O
fridge B-ART
, O
an O
oven B-ART
, O
a O
counter B-ART
with O
a O
sink B-ART
built O
in O
. O
It O
didn't O
actually O
get O
used O
all O
that O
much O
he O
always O
griped O
about O
Daisy's O
cooking O
. O
You O
never O
saw O
anything O
wrong O
with O
it O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
you've O
always O
been O
a O
fan O
of O
peanut O
butter O
sandwiches O
. O
The O
back B-ART
door O
to O
the O
kitchen B-ART
opens O
onto O
the O
forest O
to O
the O
west O
; O
to O
the O
east O
a O
doorway B-ART
leads O
into O
the O
entry O
hall O
. O


This O
is O
the O
western O
side B-ART
of O
the O
house O
, O
a O
narrow O
strip B-ART
of I-ART
grass I-ART
stretching O
from O
the O
kitchen B-ART
door I-ART
to O
the O
forest B-ART
. O
In O
one O
place O
the O
grass B-ART
has O
been O
replaced O
with O
a O
large O

The O
oddly O
empty O

completely O
devoid O
of O

Only O
a O
solitary O

reads O
Autopilot B-ART

and O
a O
red O

blinking B-ART
madly O
beneath O

This O
is O
the O
living O

of O
your O
rather O
squalid O
apartment O
. O
The O
huge O

is O
the O

The O

pretty O
grim O
these O

It's O
a O
beige O
rectangular O

with O
a O

The O
design O
of O
virtual O

can O
be O
almost O
anything B-ART

but O
in O
this O
case O
the O
room O
is O
merely O
a O
small O

an O

with O
lines B-ART
of O

A O
large O
square O

is O
inset O
into O
the O
floor O
, O
slightly O
off O
the O

sending O
the O

into O
asymmetrical O
confusion O

Wind O
whispers O
through O
the O
feathery O
branches O
of O
the O
bamboo B-ART
forest O
surrounding O
you O
as O
warm O
sunlight O
showers O
down O
, O
gently O
filtered O
by O
the O
delicate O
leaves B-ART
overhead O

The O
soft O

carpeted O
with O
slender O
browning O
leaves B-ART

occasionally O
stirred O
up O

the O

Faint O

one O

up O

a O

An O

lies O
to O
the O

How O
they O
got O
there O
after O
you O
passed O
that O
way O
last O
night O
is O
anyone's O
guess O
. O


The O
air O
in O
the O
cave O
is O
cold O
and O
damp O
. O
A O
chill O
wind O
blowing O
inwards O
from O
the O
sea B-ART
causes O
your O
eyes O
to O
sting O
in O
the O
salt O
laden O
air O
. O
The O
tide O
chews O
at O
the O
jagged B-ART
rocks I-ART
which O
protrude O
from O
the O
ocean B-ART
surface O
several O
yards O
out O
. O
Boulders O
being O
rolled O
under O
the O
surface O
make O
loud O
rumblings O
like O
distant O
thunder O
they O
sound O
like O
they O
could O
smash O
anything O
. O
The O
water B-ART
looks O
uninviting O
the O
rocks B-ART
threaten O
to O
dash O
the O
foolish O
swimmer O
to O
pieces O
. O
Behind O
you O
, O
to O
the O

is O
a O
passageway O
leading O
up O

As O
you O
stand O
with O
your O
back O
to O
the O
cliff B-ART
, O
the O
view O
ahead O
of O
you O
appears O
to O
be O
nothing O
but O
a O
blur O
fading O
from O
dark O
grey O
sea O
below B-ART
, O
through O
to O
a O
light O
powder O
blue O

Not O
much O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
this O

A O
thin O
veil O
of O

blocks O
the O

out B-ART

The O
waters B-ART

churn O
menacingly O
, O
the O
spume O
a O
milky O
white O

The O
forest O
opens O
out B-ART
into O
a O
large O
clearing O
as O
the O
trees B-ART
retreat O
from O
a O
lake B-ART
that O
dominates O
the O

. O
Flies O
lazily O
buzzing O
in O
the O
warm O

occasionally O
dip O
down O
to O
the O
water B-ART
, O
causing O
a O
ripple O
to O
break O
the O
mirror O
surface O
as O
a O
fish B-ART
reacts O
in O
kind O
. O
Not O
even O
a O
breeze O
disturbs O
the O
surface O
of O
this O
image O
of O

. O
A O
smooth O
boulder B-ART
protrudes O
from O
the O

of O
the O
lake B-ART

the O

a O

The O

The O

a O

You O
pick O

When O

It O

There O

Suddenly O
you O

a O

This O
time O
a O

You O

Though O
it O

your O

this O
is O
the O
room O
where O
you O
spend O
the O

of O

Here O

you O
do O
background O

monitor B-ART
incoming O

in O
the O

and O
hope O

On O

that O
you O

this O

as O
a O

A O

Arengario O

made O
of O
red O

Under O
the O

there O
is O
a O
portico O

You O
are O
inside O
the O
portico O
. O
There O
is O
a O
wooden B-ART
door I-ART
at O
north O
. O
Perhaps O
it O
leads O
to O
the O
main O
building O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
main O

area O
of O
your O

In O
addition O
to O
your O
bed B-ART

From O

you O
can O

out B-ART
onto O
the O

Your O
mother's B-ART
grief O
bleeds O
in O
from O
the O
north O

the O
door B-ART
to O
her O

doing O
little O

A O
few O

the O

, O
your O

looks O
out B-ART
over O
a O

From O
here O
, O
you O
can O
go O
back O

step O
south O
onto O
the O
well O
known O
path B-ART
to O
grandmother's O
house B-ART

This O
is O
where O
you've O
spent O
nearly O
half O
of O
this O
trip O
. O
You O
know O
every O
detail O
of O
the O
room B-ART
, O
from O
the O
nicks B-ART
and I-ART
scratches I-ART
on O
the O
tabletop B-ART
to O
the O
nicks B-ART
and I-ART
scratches I-ART
on O
the O
tabletop B-ART
. O
There O
are O
two O
chairs B-ART
by O
the O
table O
a O
large B-ART
one O
for O
you O
and O
a O
smaller B-ART
one O
for O
Brutus O
. O
In O
the O
weeks O
you've O
spent O
here O
, O
you've O
deigned O
to O
call O
the O
direction O
leading O
into O
your O
quarters O
east O
and O
the O
direction O
leading O
to O
Brutus' O
west O
. O
By O
deduction O
, O
you O
determine O
that O
the O
airlock B-ART
is O
north O
, O
and O
the O
galley O
is O
south O
. O


This O
is O
where O
you've O
spent O
about O
a O
third O
of O
this O
trip O
, O
mostly O
sleeping O
. O
Your O
bed B-ART
is O
pushed O
up O
against O
the O
wall B-ART
to O
make O
more O
room O
for O
you O
to O
do O
those O
forty O
early O
morning O
sit O
ups O
you O
keep O
promising O
yourself O
you'll O
start O
doing O
tomorrow O
. O
Your O
waste B-ART
disposal I-ART
unit I-ART
sits O
smugly O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
grinning O
like O
the O
cat O
that O
ate O
the O
seven O
of O
clubs O
. O
You O
can O
also O
return O
to O
the O
rec O
room O
to O
the O
west O
. O


This O
is O
where O
you've O
spent O
somewhat O
less O
than O
a O
sixth O
of O
the O
trip O
. O
You O
don't O
really O
need O
to O
spend O
much O
time O
here O
; O
the O
modern O
kitchen B-ART
has O
been O
reduced B-ART
to O
one O
simple B-ART
appliance I-ART
. O


The O
salient O
features O
of O
Brutus' O
quarters B-ART
include O
a O
large B-ART
wheel I-ART
for O
running B-ART
in O
, O
a O
small O
bed B-ART
for O
sleeping O
in O
, O
and O
a O
waste B-ART
disposal I-ART
unit I-ART
for O
other O
purposes O
. O
The O
sixteen O
week O
old O
stench O
of O
hamster B-ART
assaults O
your O
nostrils O
; O
blessed O
escape O
can O
be O
found O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
is O
the O
world O
uh O
, O
moon B-ART
famous O
Moon B-ART
Bar I-ART
, O
recently O
become O
the O
hottest O
spot O
on O
Luna O
since O
Alvin O
the O
Chipmunk O
started O
singing O
here O
. O
Tonight O
is O
as O
busy O
as O
any O
other O
night O
, O
but O
the O
crowd B-ART
of I-ART
adoring I-ART
females I-ART
swarming I-ART
the O
stage B-ART
as O
Alvin O
returns O
briefly O
to O
his O
dressing O
room O
is O
just O
going O
to O
mean O
more O
cleaning O
up O
for O
you O
later O
, O
you O
can't O
help O
thinking O
. O
A O
little O
door B-ART
behind O
the O
bar B-ART
leads O
east O
. O


Earthlight O
sheds O
a O
dim O
glow O
across O
the O
tall O
spire O
and O
broad O
basin O
of O
an O
empty O
fountain B-ART
. O
The O
fountain B-ART
is O
ringed O
with O
recessed O
lamps O
, O
but O
the O
lamps O
are O
currently O
off O
. O
The O
tall O
shadows O
of O
buildings O
block O
out B-ART
the O
stars B-ART
in O
all O
directions O
except O
west O
and O
south O
. O


This O
is O
the O
entrance B-ART
to O
the O
mysterious O
city O
where O
you O
arrived O
in O
response O
to O
the O
distress O
call O
. O
There O
is O
no O
pressure B-ART
dome O
, O
leaving O
the O
dusty O
streets O
exposed O
to O
near O
vacuum O
, O
but O
the O
buildings B-ART
have O
the O
tall O
, O
rectangular O
shapes O
familiar O
to O
you O
from O
the O
Tokyo O
skyline O
. O
Only O
the O
blue O
marble O
of O
the O
Earth O
high O
above O
sheds O
any O
light O
on O
your O
surroundings O
. O


So O
there's O
this O
forest B-ART
that's O
out B-ART
of O
the O
way O
but O
not O
too O
far O
out B-ART
of O
the O
way O
and O
some O
folks O
decided O
to O
dump O
their O
old O
household O
appliances O
. O
It's O
tradition O
, O
now O
. O
Toaster O
Hill B-ART
is O
entirely O
literal O
; O
it O
overlooks O
a O
winding O
road O
to O
the O
south O
with O
what O
has O
to O
be O
20 O
or O
30 O
old O
toasters B-ART
. O
The O
flashlight's B-ART
reflection O
gives O
the O
toasters B-ART
a O
dull O
, O
gentle O
glare O
. O


Ok O
, O
mostly O
microwaves B-ART
. O
The O
flashlight B-ART
and I-ART
starlight I-ART
together O
make O
them O
look O
like O
monoliths O
. O
You O
can O
keep O
going O
south O
if O
you O
like O
. O


This O
is O
absurd O
and O
sad O
and O
weird O
and O
you've O
always O
wondered O
about O
this O
place B-ART
, O
because O
there's O
an O
old O
dishwasher B-ART
that O
must O
have O
been O
there O
for O
ages O
, O
before O
the O
dumping O
began O
, O
because O
there's O
plants B-ART
and I-ART
roots I-ART
and O
weird O
vines B-ART
and I-ART
tubers I-ART
and O
stuff O
growing O
through O
it O
, O
and O
it's O
become O
part O
of O
the O
forest B-ART
. O
The O
normal O
trees B-ART
all O
keep O
a O
distance O
like O
they're O
afraid O
. O
Your O
illumination O
, O
impressively O
, O
manages O
to O
fill O
the O
entire O
clearing B-ART
. O
You O
can O
still O
go O
further O
south O
. O


Yeah O
people O
are O
just O
sick O
because O
this O
is O
the O
part O
way O
off O
the O
road O
yet O
there's O
at O
least O
10 O
fridges B-ART
arranged O
like O
they O
were O
Legos O
or O
something O
. O
Even O
granting O
some O
of O
them O
are O
only O
half O
a O
refrigerator B-ART
that's O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
to O
dump O
this O
far O
in O
. O
Maybe O
someone's O
made O
a O
ritual O
out B-ART
of O
this O
? O
There's O
still O
more O
to O
the O
south O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
next O
to O
a O
statue B-ART
of O
a O
very O
attractive O
nude O
woman O
wearing O
strategically O
placed O
figleaves B-ART
. O
You O
can O
see O
a O
path O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
motel B-ART
lobby O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
made O
of O
marble O
tiles O
in O
a O
checkerboard O
pattern O
. O
Along O
the O
wall O
is O
the O
front O
desk B-ART
. O
The O
motel B-ART
manager I-ART
, O
a O
very O
sedated O
looking O
gentleman O
, O
stands O
behind O
the O
front O
desk B-ART
. O


The O
motel's O
gift O
shoppe O
contains O
a O
variety O
of O
knick O
knacks O
and O
souvenirs O
. O
For O
some O
reason O
, O
all O
the O
merchandise O
is O
locked O
within O
Plexiglas O
displays B-ART
. O


Room O
108 O
is O
less O
of O
a O
room O
for O
guests O
, O
and O
more O
of O
a O
tiny O
, O
intimate O
venue O
with O
a O
puppet O
theater B-ART
. O
There O
are O
no O
chairs O
in O
the O
room O
, O
so O
you O
assume O
the O
audience O
must O
sit O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O


Among O
the O
cars O
parked O
in O
the O
lot O
is O
your O
van B-ART
. O
The O
pavement O
is O
warm O
under O
the O
bright O
sun O
above O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
amidst O
the O
snow B-ART
covered I-ART
trees I-ART
of I-ART
Burly I-ART
Forest I-ART
, O
looking O
upward B-ART
to O
the O
mountain B-ART
you're O
delaying O
climbing O
. O


Rocky O
holds B-ART
push O
their O
way O
out O
of O
this O
incline B-ART
here O
and O
there O
, O
making O
it O
a O
little O
less O
of O
an O
incline B-ART
and O
a O
little O
more O
of O
a O
climb O
. O
The O
foot B-ART
of O
the O
mountain B-ART
is O
a O
fair O
way O
down O
from O
here O
. O
Up O
above O
you O
, O
you O
can O
see O
a O
nice O
much O
more O
comfortable B-ART
plateau B-ART
you'd O
rather O
be O
standing O
on O
. O


Sort O
of O
an O
intersection O
of O
treacherous O
climbs O
, O
this O
plateau B-ART
disappears O
into O
a O
more O
rubble B-ART
like I-ART
path B-ART
around O
both B-ART
the O
east O
and O
west O
sides O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O
A O
brief O
sigh O
of O
lack O
of O
accomplishment O
falls O
upon O
you O
as O
you O
look O
up O
to O
see O
how O
much O
of O
the O
mountain O
you've O
yet O
to O
climb O
. O
You O
know O
, O
you O
could O
always O
go O
back O
down O
. O


Many O
winter B-ART
snowfalls I-ART
have O
taken O
their O
toll O
on O
this O
traverse B-ART
. O
Hard O
, O
easily O
grippable O
rock O
has O
given O
away O
to O
a O
mostly O
smooth O
icy O
surface O
. O
Stray O
from O
the O
path O
here O
, O
and O
you'll O
most O
likely O
fall O
to O
your O
icy O
death O
. O
You O
shudder O
as O
you O
imagine O
sliding O
helplessly O
downward B-ART
. O


Snug O
and O
dry O
, O
there's O
really O
no O
place O
like O
home O
. O
This O
vaulting O
cavern O
offers O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
unfurled O
wings B-ART
and O
the O
sandy O
floor O
, O
good O
purchase O
for O
extended O
talons O
. O
Bright O
daylight O
streams O
in O
through O
a O
large O
circular O
hole O
to O
the O
west O
. O
East O
, O
a O
smaller O
, O
darker O
opening O
plunges O
deeper O
into O
the O
mountain O
. O


The O
cave O
narrows O
here O
into O
a O
corridor O
with O
dark O
holes O
branching O
off O
to O
the O
north O
and O
south O
. O
A O
larger O
, O
lighter O
one O
leads O
back B-ART
west O
. O


The O
diffuse O
light O
is O
a O
bit O
dim B-ART
here O
, O
but O
that's O
okay O
since O
you O
usually O
only O
use O
your O
room O
for O
sleeping O
anyway O
. O
Sigh O
. O
Lacking O
your O
own O
hoard O
of O
gold O
to O
gloat O
over O
, O
you O
really O
don't O
need O
it O
for O
much O
else O
. O


Here O
you O
spend O
your O
sleeping O
hours O
. O
Margaret O
was O
, O
just O
like O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
house O
, O
responsible O
for O
decorating O
and O
arranging O
the O
room B-ART
when O
you O
moved O
in O
. O
Without O
a O
doubt O
, O
she O
did O
this O
with O
her O
very O
own O
eye O
for O
detail O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
, O
she O
hinted O
that O
you O
have O
been O
insufficiently O
appreciative O
of O
this O
. O
Maybe O
, O
but O
you O
do O
recognize O
the O
things O
of O
real O
practical O
value O
, O
like O
the O
calendar B-ART
on O
the O
wall O
, O
at O
least O
! O


This O
is O
the O
house's B-ART
central O
hub O
. O
All O
other O
rooms O
, O
i O
. O
e O
. O
the O
bedroom O
, O
the O
kitchen O
, O
the O
bathroom O
and O
the O
currently O
unused O
room O
, O
can O
be O
reached O
from O
here O
. O
Aside O
from O
that O
, O
the O
front O
door B-ART
, O
located O
next O
to O
a O
large O
panorama B-ART
window I-ART
, O
leads O
right O
into O
this O
room O
. O
Because O
of O
the O
number O
of O
exits B-ART
, O
there O
isn't O
actually O
all O
this O
much O
usable O
space O
available O
, O
but O
Margaret O
has O
come O
up O
with O
a O
clever O
arrangement O
of O
the O
sofa B-ART
and O
the O
matching O
table B-ART
as O
well O
as O
the O
slender O
floor O
lamp B-ART
which O
really O
gets O
the O
maximum O
out B-ART
of O
it O
! O


The O
bathroom's B-ART
walls O
are O
brightly O
tiled B-ART
. O
Even O
though O
you O
can't O
tell O
for O
sure O
, O
you O
would O
bet O
that O
Margaret O
cleans O
it O
daily O
. O
Appropriate O
to O
your O
house's O
year O
of O
construction O
, O
the O
facilities B-ART
are O
modern O
. O
For O
example O
, O
you O
had O
a O
shower B-ART
built O
in O
instead O
of O
a O
tub O
. O
Next O
to O
that O
, O
there O
is O
a O
sink B-ART
with O
a O
mirror B-ART
hung O
to O
the O
wall O
above O
, O
and O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
room O
, O
there O
is O
a O
toilet B-ART
. O
A O
small O
cabinet B-ART
stands O
on O
the O
side O
wall O
. O
The O
only O
exit O
leads O
into O
the O
living O
room O
. O


This O
is O
Margaret's B-ART
realm O
. O
For O
you O
, O
it's O
more O
a O
passage O
between O
the O
living O
room O
and O
the O
garden B-ART
. O
In O
front O
of O
you O
, O
the O
familiar O
sight O
unfolds O
of O
Margaret B-ART
standing O
with O
her O
back B-ART
to O
you O
, O
slightly O
bent O
over O
the O
countertop B-ART
and O
hard O
at O
work B-ART
with O
her O
kitchen B-ART
utensils I-ART
. O
On O
the O
level O
of O
her O
head O
, O
a O
row O
of O
cabinets B-ART
hangs O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
on O
another O
wall O
, O
there O
is O
a O
refrigerator B-ART
. O

which O
can O
be O
reached O
from O
the O
living B-ART
room O
, O
is O
currently O
unused B-ART
. O
You O
have O
some O
hopeful O
plans O
for O
it O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
they O
haven't O
worked O
out B-ART
yet O
. O
Until O
then O
, O
Margaret O
has O
decided O
not O
to O
use O
the O
room O
for O
anything O
at O
all O
to O
avoid O
any O
discussion O
later O
. O
You O
haven't O
even O
painted O
the O
walls B-ART
, O
to O
be O
flexible O
as O
far O
as O
the O
coloring O
is O
concerned O
as O
soon O
as O
its O
new O
inhabitant O
will O
move O
in O
. O
There O
is O
a O
connecting B-ART
door B-ART
in O
the O
direction O
of O
your O
bedroom B-ART
. O


The O
steps B-ART
to O
the O
imposing O
front O
of O
the O
museum B-ART
lead O
up O
to O
the O
north O
, O
shimmering O
orange O
in O
the O
reflection O
of O
the O
streetlamp's O
light B-ART
. O
The O
facade B-ART
is O
dull O
and O
flat O
like O
a O
concrete O
tower O
block O
but O
for O
this O
portico B-ART
, O
which O
has O
a O
couple O
of O
sculptures B-ART
. O
Here O
by O
your O
feet O
, O
for O
example O
, O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
stone B-ART
crocuses I-ART
. O
Further O
up O
are O
some O
gargoyles B-ART
on O
pillars B-ART
. O


The O
marble O
walls O
and O
floor O
have O
fallen O
into O
shadow O
from O
the O
overhang B-ART
, O
low O
over O
your O
head O
and O
near O
enough O
to O
touch O
. O
It O
is O
supported O
by O
two O
wide O
pillars B-ART
, O
one O
either O
side O
carved B-ART
with O
a O
dragon B-ART
and O
a O
unicorn B-ART
. O
Quaint O
. O
To O
the O
north O
are O
the O
glass B-ART
double O
doors B-ART
of O
the O
place O
; O
there's O
a O
keypad B-ART
in O
the O
wall O
by O
them O
. O
Bushes B-ART
grow O
right O
up O
to O
you O
to O
the O
east O
. O


Suddenly O
you O
are O
hemmed O
in O
, O
by O
bushes B-ART
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
the O
museum B-ART
building I-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
a O
tall O
wall B-ART
to O
the O
south O
. O
Your O
torch B-ART
light I-ART
flicks O
around O
the O
space O
, O
dragging O
a O
lit O
circle O
with O
makes O
your O
eyes O
sting O
; O
flecking O
on O
the O
unkempt O
grass O
under O
your O
feet O
. O


This O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
gardens B-ART
, O
by O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
museum B-ART
. O
Tangled O
bushes B-ART
grow O
in O
a O
heap O
in O
the O
pinch O
of O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
starting O
right B-ART
at O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
frozen B-ART
river I-ART
to O
your O
west O
. O
The O
gardens B-ART
continue O
cold O
, O
dark O
, O
and O
who O
knows O
how O
big O
up O
rising O
ground B-ART
to O
the O
northeast O
. O
A O
more O
comforting O
sight O
is O
the O
door B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
which O
leads O
inside O
. O


The O
grass O
turns O
into O
a O
path O
of O
small O
pebbles O
here O
, O
as O
it O
runs O
uphill O
in O
a O
tight O
tunnel O
between O
the O
museum B-ART
to O
your O
west O
and O
the O
perimeter O
wall B-ART
. O
The O
path O
branches O
, O
and O
twists O
in O
a O
figure O
eight O
around O
two O
sculptures B-ART
. O
The O
first O
is O
a O
stone B-ART
plinth I-ART
a O
sundial B-ART
looking O
more O
like O
a O
treestump O
in O
the O
dark O
. O
The O
second O
took O
a O
while O
to O
notice O
. O
It's O
a O
mosaic B-ART
, O
across O
the O
grass O
. O


And O
here O
is O
the O
far O
end O
of O
the O
garden B-ART
, O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
hill O
which O
has O
buried O
one O
floor O
of O
the O
museum B-ART
beneath O
it O
. O
This O
spot O
is O
a O
cafe B-ART
, O
though O
it O
can't O
get O
much O
custom O
. O
The O
furniture B-ART
is O
spartan O
just O
one O
table B-ART
and O
shabby O
, O
mouldy O
from O
being O
out O
in O
the O
rain O
. O
The O
wall B-ART
to O
the O
east O
dimples O
to O
hold O
a O
group O
of O
two O
trees B-ART
, O
and O
then O
continues O
north O
until O
it O
curves O
to O
meet O
the O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
museum B-ART
. O


The O
small O
kitchen B-ART
of O
the O
cafe O
is O
barren O
, O
understocked O
, O
and O
totally O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
age O
of O
the O
furniture O
back O
east O
. O
There O
is O
a O
single O
worktop B-ART
, O
and O
beneath O
this O
is O
a O
broken O
oven B-ART
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
a O
pantry O
. O


This O
is O
just O
a O
patch O
of O
long O
grass O
between O
the O
trunks B-ART
of O
two O
large O
beech B-ART
trees I-ART
, O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
gardens O
back O
west O
, O
and O
the O
wall B-ART
looping O
around O
on O
all O
the O
other O
sides O
. O


Your O
dining B-ART
room I-ART
is O
done O
up O
in O
paisley B-ART
wallpaper I-ART
of O
which O
you've O
never O
been O
very O
fond O
, O
but O
it O
was O
there O
when O
you O
moved O
in O
and O
you O
never O
got O
around O
to O
replacing O
it O
. O
A O
cheap O
light B-ART
fixture I-ART
dangles O
from O
the O
ceiling O
, O
though O
currently O
the O
room B-ART
is O
lit O
by O
sunlight B-ART
streaming O
through O
the O
window B-ART
. O
The O
kitchen O
lies O
west O
of O
here O
; O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
house O
is O
to O
the O
south O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
small O
room O
with O
a O
sectional O
sofa B-ART
, O
a O
computer B-ART
, O
and O
some O
musical O
equipment B-ART
. O
A O
door O
lies O
to O
the O
north O
. O


The O
front O
yard O
is O
fairly O
small O
with O
empty O
flowerbeds O
around O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
yard O
. O
A O
mailbox B-ART
is O
by O
the O
street O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
sidewalk O
leading O
north O
to O
the O
driveway O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
a O
silver O
Ford B-ART
Taurus I-ART
and O
a O
white O
Ford B-ART
Explorer I-ART
. O
A O
garage O
door B-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
a O
sidewalk O
leads O
south O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
back O
yard O
. O
The O
yard O
is O
lined O
with O
a O
wooden O
fence O
on O
all O
sides O
. O
There O
is O
a O
pitbull O
staring O
at O
you O
and O
panting O
in O
a O
non O
threatening O
way O
. O
There O
is O
a O
toolbox B-ART
by O
the O
door O
and O
a O
trampoline O
in O
the O
yard O
. O
A O
door O
lies O
to O
the O
west O
. O


The O
vast B-ART
windows I-ART
of O
the O
gondola B-ART
offer O
a O
commanding O
view B-ART
of O
the O
ruddy B-ART
sun I-ART
as O
it O
sets O
into O
the O
darkening B-ART
sea I-ART
. O
The O
only O
landmark O
in O
sight O
is O
the O
great O
Gothic B-ART
tower I-ART
the O
airship B-ART
is O
tethered O
to O
an O
incredible O
stack O
of O
columns B-ART
, I-ART
arches I-ART
and I-ART
buttresses I-ART
stretching O
far O
down O
into O
the O
roiling B-ART
waves I-ART
. O


Grey O
and O
turbulent B-ART
, O
the O
clouds B-ART
above O
and O
ocean B-ART
below O
stretch O
off O
towards O
the O
blood B-ART
red I-ART
setting B-ART
sun I-ART
. O
We O
are O
atop O
a O
simple O
circle O
of O
mildewed B-ART
stone I-ART
, O
seemingly O
suspended O
in O
mid O
air B-ART
without O
guardrail O
or O
balustrade O
. O
A O
low B-ART
dome I-ART
stands O
at O
the O
circle's O
centre O
. O


The O
wind B-ART
screams O
across O
this O
narrow B-ART
ledge I-ART
. O
The O
snow B-ART
you O
waded O
through O
before O
has O
been O
scoured O
from O
this O
rock B-ART
. O
The O
icy O
gusts B-ART
cut O
straight O
through O
the O
clothing B-ART
you O
wear O
, O
you O
gasp O
for O
breath O
in O
the O
frozen O
air B-ART
. O
Turning O
your O
head O
away O
from O
the O
biting O
wind B-ART
, O
you O
strain O
to O
see O
in O
the O
stark O
white O
and O
black O
landscape O
around O
you O
, O
and O
your O
heart O
begins O
to O
beat O
faster O
. O
A O
glint B-ART
, O
not O
far O
above O
this O
ledge B-ART
, O
of O
something O
that O
is O
neither O
ice B-ART
or O
rock B-ART
. O
You O
should O
never O
have O
doubted O
, O
the O
tales O
were O
true O
! O


A O
dream O
kitchen O
. O
Well O
, O
my O
parents' O
dream O
kitchen O
. O
Lupe O
, O
our O
housekeeper O
, O
is O
the O
only O
one O
who O
spends O
time O
in O
here O
, O
and O
she O
doesn't O
care O
. O
Mom O
would O
probably O
want O
me O
to O
draw O
attention O
to O
the O
maple O
cabinets B-ART
and I-ART
drawers I-ART
, O
and O
the O
granite B-ART
counters I-ART
. O
She's O
wouldn't O
want O
me O
to O
mention O
the O
old O
, O
battered O
appliances B-ART
. O
The O
fridge B-ART
is O
humming O
in O
the O
corner O

Stove B-ART
in O
the O
other O
corner O

The O
living O

The O

I O
wake O
peacefully O
, O
and O
already O
she O
is O
there O
. O
My O
angel O
she O
is O
all O
around O
me O
. O
Her O
presence O
is O
like O
ice O
on O
water O
. O
But O
she O
is O
less O
than O
peaceful O
. O
My O
thoughts O
are O
all O
of O
raging O
storm O
clouds O
. O
Hurriedly O
, O
I O
drag O
myself B-ART


I O
shake O
my O
head O
of O
sleep O
, O
look O
around O
the O
place O
for O
one O
last O
time O
. O
The O
thick O
wet O
straw B-ART
lining O
the O
loft O
which O
as O
been O
my O
bed O
for O
so O
long B-ART
. O
The O
rickety B-ART
old O
ladder B-ART
down O
to O
ground B-ART
level O
, O
at O
the O
foot B-ART
of O
which O
mill O
a O
few O
cows B-ART
, O
warbling O
quietly O
, O
by O
the O
gate B-ART
. O
Then O
I O
shake O
myself B-ART
; O
there's O
no O
time O
for O
nostalgia O
, O
for O
good O
byes O
. O
There O
is O
time O
only O
to O
grab O
my O
bag B-ART
, O
go O
, O
and O
find O
her O
. O


Big O
. O
That's O
really O
the O
only O
word O
that O
comes O
to O
mind O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
huge O
tower B-ART
of I-ART
steel I-ART
before O
you O
Footnote O

. O
From O
the O
look O
of O
it O
, O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
about O
806 O
feet O
tall O
, O
give O
or O
take O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
this O
much O
steel B-ART
, O
arranged O
in O
this O
high O
, O
vertical O
confirmation O
makes O
you O
, O
well O
. O
. O
. O
It O
makes O
you O
wonder O
why O
you O
came O
to O
Paris O
anyway O
. O
And O
, O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
where O
you O
got O
the O
money O
, O
since O
you're O
a O
penniless O
drifter O
Footnote O

Stairs B-ART

up O

into O
the O

Footnote O

You're O
standing O
on O
the O
freaking O
huge O
stairway B-ART
running O
up O
the O
eiffel B-ART
tower I-ART
. O
You O
can O
proceed O
in O
either O
of O
the O
more O
basic O
vertical O
directions O
. O


It's O
like O
stately O
Wayne O
manor O
, O
in O
that O
it's O
on O
top O
of O
a O
hill O
, O
and O
it's O
very O
expansive O
and O
full O
of O
expensive B-ART
things I-ART
, O
but O
there's O
no O
labyrinthine O
cave O
system O
underneath O
it O
. O
There's O
even O
a O
big B-ART
grandfather I-ART
clock B-ART
in O
here O
, O
that O
symbolizes O
punctuality O
, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
tell O
the O
time O
. O
Because O
it's O
a O
dream O
! O


So O
, O
from O
up O
here O
in O
front O
of O
the O
stately O
manor O
, O
you O
can O
see O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
island O
. O
To O
your O
right O
, O
which O
is O
west O
of O
you O
if O
you're O
facing O
south O
, O
is O
a O
thick O
jungle B-ART
, O
with O
leaves O
that O
are O
deep O
greens O
and O
purples O
in O
their O
colors O
. O
It O
symbolizes O
the O
terror O
and O
the O
wonderment O
of O
the O
unknown O
. O
But O
it O
is O
impenetrable O
to O
you O
from O
where O
you're O
standing O
. O


The O
gulf B-ART
that O
this O
enchanted O
beach B-ART
envelops O
is O
itself O
enchanted O
, O
or O
ensorcelled O
, O
with O
a O
magical B-ART
glamour I-ART
which O
makes O
everyone O
who O
sees O
it O
want O
to O
just O
sit O
around O
and O
take O
a O
break O
for O
once O
in O
their O
lives O
. O
It O
symbolizes O
taking O
a O
break O
for O
once O
in O
your O
life O
. O
Only O
you O
are O
able O
to O
resist O
this O
enchantment B-ART
, O
because O
you O
alone O
are O
so O
incredibly O
uptight O
about O
getting O
stuff O
done O
all O
the O
time O
and O
being O
on O
time O
for O
things O
. O


When O
you O
are O
inside O
the O
ship B-ART
, O
you O
realize O
that O
it O
symbolizes B-ART
loneliness O
. O
Specifically O
, O
loneliness O
brought O
on O
by O
being O
an O
artist O
, O
which O
all O
artists O
suffer O
from O
deep O
inside O
their O
souls O
. O


I O
keep O
forgetting O
what O
this O
jungle B-ART
is O
supposed O
to O
symbolize O
. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
ignorance O
. O
The O
branches B-ART
, O
heavy O
with O
purple B-ART
leaves I-ART
, O
lean O
down O
toward O
you O
in O
a O
vaguely O
threatening O
way O
. O
It's O
a O
scary O
experience O
, O
but O
it's O
also O
kind O
of O
exciting O
. O
That's O
the O
fun O
of O
being O
in O
a O
coma O
induced O
dream O
world O
. O


This O
is O
an O
open O
area O
in O
the O
jungle B-ART
, I-ART
symbolizing I-ART
the O
eye O
of O
the O
storm O
. O
It O
isn't O
the O
center O
of O
the O
jungle B-ART
, O
but O
it's O
the O
center O
of O
your O
experience O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
. O
It's O
like O
the O
guy O
says O
Wherever O
you O
go O
, O
there O
you O
are O
. O


About O
two B-ART
dozen O
people B-ART
in O
various B-ART
costumes I-ART
mill O
around O
. O
Balloons B-ART
and I-ART
streamers I-ART
abound O
. O
You O
stand O
near O
the O
refreshment B-ART
table B-ART
, O
trying O
not O
to O
look O
bored O
, O
or O
like O
the O
crasher O
you O
are O
. O


This O
is O
a O
very O
sad O
way O
. O
Sad O
, O
sad O
indeed O
. O
Sad O
because O
of O
what O
happened O
with O
Deb O
? O
Or O
because O
of O
the O
sadness O
of O
existence O
? O
Either O
way O
, O
the O
way O
continues O
to O
the O
west O
and O
to O
the O
north O
. O
And O
never O
did O
that O
poem B-ART
you're O
holding O
in O
your O
hand O
seem O
more O
relevant O
. O


It's O
a O
long O
, O
lonely O
stretch O
of O
black B-ART
asphalt O
and O
yellow O
painted O
lines B-ART
, O
not O
to O
mention O
vehicles B-ART
of O
all O
makes O
and O
models O
. O
Neon O
Nirvana O
is O
lit O
up O
like O
a O
busy O
supermarket O
at O
night O
. O
The O
parking B-ART
lot I-ART
is O
bright O
, O
quiet O
and O
empty O
. O
A O
short O
path B-ART
leads O
from O
the O
lot B-ART
to O
the O
sidewalk O
outside B-ART
the O
club O
. O


As O
the O
wind O
blows O
, O
it O
shuffles O
around O
assorted O
bits O
of O
litter B-ART
, I-ART
leaves I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
rubbish I-ART
that O
congest O
the O
sidewalk B-ART
. O
A O
bit O
of O
graffiti B-ART
is O
spray O
painted O
on O
the O
sidewalk B-ART
. O
You O
can O
almost O
feel O
evil O
lurking O
in O
the O
dark O
cracks O
of O
the O
pavement O
. O
This O
is O
a O
high O
crime O
area O
, O
and O
you're O
cold O
and O
lonely O
. O
You O
long O
to O
leave O
, O
either O
by O
approaching O
the O
nightclub B-ART
to O
the O
north O
, O
continuing O
east O
and O
west O
on O
the O
sidewalk B-ART
, O
or O
using O
a O
small O
concrete O
path O
leading O
southeast O
. O


A O
tiny O
alley B-ART
separates O
the O
nightclub O
from O
the O
next O
building O
over O
, O
which O
is O
some O
sort O
of O
hardware O
store O
. O
The O
street O
and O
sidewalk O
bend O
south O
before O
they O
pass O
the O
alley B-ART
entrance O
, O
so O
the O
alley B-ART
is O
very O
quiet O
and O
secluded O
, O
but O
oddly O
well O
lit O
for O
such O
a O
lonely O
place O
. O
The O
walls O
of O
the O
club B-ART
and O
hardware O
store O
make O
up O
the O
west O
and O
east O
walls O
of O
the O
alley B-ART
, O
and O
the O
building O
behind O
both B-ART
makes O
up O
the O
north O
wall O
, O
which O
is O
uninteresting O
except O
for O
a O
small O
metal O
door B-ART
set O
into O
it O
. O
The O
alley B-ART
can O
be O
left O
to O
the O
west O
. O


The O
sidewalk B-ART
continues O
here O
to O
the O
east O
and O
west O
. O
This O
particular O
section O
passes O
by O
a O
small O
pavilion B-ART
, O
holding O
tables O
and O
chairs O
for O
those O
who O
wish O
to O
have O
their O
drink O
outside B-ART
in O
the O
night O
air O
. O
Due O
to O
the O
chill O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
nobody's O
been O
out O
here O
tonight O
. O
Well O
, O
one O
or O
two B-ART
, O
maybe O
, O
but O
they're O
long O
gone O
now O
. O
A O
wrought O
iron O
balustrade B-ART
separates O
the O
pavilion B-ART
from O
the O
common O
sidewalk B-ART
. O
A O
small O
gate B-ART
in O
the O
balustrade B-ART
, O
unlocked O
and O
open O
, O
allows O
you O
to O
enter O
the O
pavilion B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


Stone O
walls B-ART
, O
wreathed O
in O
shadows O
and O
velvet B-ART
curtains I-ART
, O
rise O
into O
the O
gloom O
overhead O
. O
The O
old B-ART
oak I-ART
writing O
desk B-ART
once O
your O
father's O
, O
now O
your O
own O
is O
wedged O
beneath O
the O
window B-ART
lattice I-ART
, O
with O
a O
velvet B-ART
couch I-ART
before O
it O
. O
A O
low O
fire B-ART
smoulders O
in O
its O
ancient O
hearth B-ART
. O
To O
the O
southeast O
, O
a O
bust B-ART
of I-ART
Pallas I-ART
sits O
atop O
an O
arch B-ART
with O
darkness B-ART
beyond O
. O


You O
live O
in O
a O
nice O
soft O
place O
inside O
a O
bigger O
space O
that O
has O
three O
ows O
, O
and O
one O
moveable O
ow O
. O
You O
call O
these O
things O
ows O
because O
they O
hurt O
when O
you O
run O
into O
them O
, O
and O
the O
moveable O
ow O
mow O
only O
He O
can O
move O
. O
The O
soft O
place O
is O
where O
you O
sleep O
and O
it O
smells O
like O
you O
. O
Outside B-ART
is O
where O
He O
puts O
the O
food O
and O
water O
. O
The O
food O
is O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
milk O
you O
used O
to O
have O
was O
much O
better O
. O
You O
wonder O
if O
He O
could O
get O
some O
of O
that O
again O
. O
He O
always O
shuts O
the O
mow O
, O
but O
today O
He O
has O
left O
it O
open O
. O


Your O
Place O
surrounds O
the O
soft O
place O
. O
It's O
much O
bigger O
and O
it O
is O
soft O
on O
your O
feet O
, O
but O
not O
as O
soft O
as O
the O
soft O
place O
. O
You O
can O
run O
around O
here O
but O
the O
three O
ows B-ART
stop O
you O
. O
Nothing O
has O
changed O
from O
this O
morning O
when O
He O
left B-ART
the O
food B-ART
dish I-ART
, O
the O
water B-ART
bowl I-ART
, O
the O
sandbox B-ART
, O
and O
the O
ledge B-ART
are O
in O
their O
same O
places O
and O
they O
smell O
the O
same O
. O
The O
most O
interesting O
thing O
, O
though O
, O
is O
the O
mow B-ART
. O
It's O
wide O
open O
in O
front O
of O
you O
. O


This O
is O
a O
strange O
place O
. O
It's O
long O
, O
like O
maybe O
if O
your O
place O
were O
stretched O
out B-ART
to O
your O
right O
and O
to O
your O
left O
taller O
than O
He O
is O
. O
The O
scents O
that O
invaded O
your O
place O
came O
from O
here O
, O
or O
at O
least O
some O
of O
them O
did O
. O
The O
ows B-ART
are O
dabbed O
with O
white O
that O
doesn't O
go O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
ow O
and O
they O
smell O
new O
somehow O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
soft O
like O
it O
is O
in O
your O
place O
but O
it O
smells O
wild O
full O
of O
scents O
that O
draw O
you O
to O
investigate O
them O
. O
Faintly O
, O
you O
also O
detect O
a O
sweet O
yet O
salty O
wild O
smell O
that O
can O
only O
be O
Goodcat O
Badcat O
. O


This O
wide O
chamber O
is O
best O
known O
for O
its O
long O
paneless O
window O
, O
providing O
the O
best O
view O
of O
the O
northern O
holdings O
of O
Restia O
. O
Beyond O
that O
, O
furnishings O
are O
sparse O
; O
other O
than O
the O
bedroll B-ART
you O
deposited O
here O
, O
the O
only O
permanent O
fixtures O
the O
curtains B-ART
adorning O
the O
one O
exit O
to O
the O
south O
. O


Much O
of O
the O
top O
floor O
of O
the O
Imperial O
Palace O
is O
given O
over O
to O
this O
central O

Designed O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
cross O
with O
the O
center O
holding O
an O
elaborate B-ART
fountain I-ART
, O
a O
number O
of O
open O
skylights O
would O
normally O
provide O
natural O
illumination O
and O
circulation O
, O
but O
tonight O
it O
is O
largely O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
smothered O
shadows O
. O


You O

some O
small B-ART

The O
only O
homey O
touch O
is O
a O

An O

A O

if O
a O
bit O
cramped O
. O
Two O

this O
small O
room O
. O
A O
window B-ART
to O
the O
west O
reveals O
the O
countryside O
. O


The O
lounge O
car O
is O
a O
fine O
place O
to O
sit O
and O
relax O
. O
Windows B-ART
to O
the O

of O
the O
large O
building B-ART
which O
supposedly O
contains O
the O

Directly O
to O
the O
north O
, O
there O
is O
a O
big O
gate B-ART
like O
entrance B-ART
portal I-ART
leading O
inside O
. O
The O
building B-ART
stretches O
quite O
far O
to O
one O
side O
so O
that O
its O
left O
side O
is O
hardly O
visible O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O
To O
the O
northeast O
, O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
building B-ART
which O
is O
comparatively O
small O
can O
be O
seen O
. O
You O
arrived O
here O
from O
the O
south O
, O
so O
this O
is O
a O
likely O
escape O
route O
. O


This O
wing O
of O
the O
building B-ART
is O
relatively O
small O
. O
You O
can O
see O
a O
door B-ART
in O
the O
wall B-ART
directly O
west O
of O
you O
. O
To O
the O

quite O
a O
few O

here O
. O
The O

the O
building B-ART

You O
sneak O
along O
the O
largest O

of O
the O
building B-ART

pressing O
yourself B-ART
to O
the O
wall B-ART
in O
order O
to O
avoid O

, O
you O
can O
go O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O

The O
living O
room O
is O
tastefully O
decorated O
. O
The O
furniture O
is O
arranged B-ART
to O
make O
maximum O
use O
of O
the O
limited O
space O
. O
A O
bookshelf B-ART
takes O
up O
one O
wall B-ART
, O
while O
a O

are O
pushed O
up O
against O

is O
a O

This O
is O
a O
small O

The O
only O
things O
of O

This O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
combination O
bedroom B-ART
computer B-ART
room O
. O
A O
futon B-ART
occupies O
one O
corner O
, O
while O
a O

other O
assorted B-ART

Like O
everything B-ART

Getting O
to O
sleep O
in O
the O
master O
bedroom B-ART
is O
only O
one O
of O
the O
many O
advantages O
you O
enjoy O
as O
a O
new O
home O
owner O
. O
This O
bedroom B-ART
is O
actually O
smaller O
than O
the O
one O
you O
lived O
in O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
a O
thousand O
miles O
away O
, O
but O
as O
much O
as O
you O
love O
your O
old O
roommates O
, O
you O
have O
no O
desire O
to O
go O
back O
to O
living O
in O
a O

Your O
bed B-ART
sits O

to O
the O
west O
. O


There's O
not O
nearly O
enough O
counter B-ART
space O
in O
your O
bathroom B-ART
, O
so O
every O
available O
surface O
except O
for O
the O
toilet B-ART
seat O
is O
covered O
with O
vitamin B-ART
bottles I-ART

Your O

to O
the O

There's O
nothing O
to O
look O
at O
here O
. O
Well O
, O
there O
may O
be O
, O
but O
without O

the O

is O
rather O
moot O

Above O
the O
ocean B-ART
is O
a O
stirring O
sunset B-ART
, O
the O
kind O
that O
would O
put O
young O
couples O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
porking O
of O
the O
romantic O
variety O
. O
Unfortunately O
for O
you O
, O
you're O
on O
your O
own O
. O
High O
cliffs B-ART
climb O
above O
you O
to O
the O
east O

south O
, O
and O
a O
path O
winds O
through O
small O
sand B-ART
dunes I-ART
to O
the O

. O


You're O
now O
on O
Kelly O
Street O
. O
On O
the O

are O
four O
high O
palm B-ART
trees I-ART

gently O
swaying O
in O
the O

. O
Below O
them O
is O
a O
large O
bush B-ART
. O
On O
the O

side O
of O
the O

returns O
east O
to O
the O
beach O
. O
To O
the O
north O
and O
south O
are O
carnivorous O
dinosaurs B-ART
. O
They O
eye O
you O
with O
razor O
toothed O
interest O
. O


The O
center O
of O
this O
small O
village O
is O
a O
roughly O
circular O
clearing B-ART
in O
the O
jungle O
forest B-ART
that O
covers O
most O
of O
this O
island O
. O
A O
gigantic B-ART
tree I-ART
stands O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
reaching O
hundreds O
of O
feet O
up O
into O
the O
cool O
night O
air O
. O
The O
huts B-ART
of O
the O
villagers O
are O
strewn O
around O
the O
clearing's B-ART
border O
, O
close O
to O
the O
jungle O
. O
A O
large B-ART
stone I-ART
circle I-ART
contains O
charred B-ART
wood O
from O

there O
is O
a O
rickety B-ART
wooden I-ART

under O
one O
of O
the O
lower O
branches B-ART
of O
the O
tree B-ART
. O


The O
cottage's O
interior O
is O
rather O
nice O
, O
actually O
. O
A O
heavy O
marble O
table O
sits O
among O
ruby O
tiles B-ART
, O
gold O
trimming O
lines O
ornate O

and O
the O
sapphire B-ART
studded O

This O
grey O
area O
is O
filled O
with O
stone B-ART
sculptures I-ART
of O
all O
types O
of O
creatures B-ART
. O
Upon O
closer O
examination O
you O
note O
they O
are O
extraordinarily O
well O
carved O
. O
A O
strange O
feeling O
you O
usually O
don't O
get O
in O
museums O
comes O
over O
you O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
base O
of O
a O
small O
hill B-ART
in O
the O
land O
of O
Mount O
Moriah B-ART
. O
The O
path B-ART
upward O
towards O
the O

The O
path O
gradually O
winds O
upwards O
towards O
the O
hill O
top B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O
South O
is O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
mountain B-ART
from O
which O
you O
came O
. O


The O
path O
levels O
out B-ART
to O
a O
plateau B-ART
. O
The O
trail O
continues O
to O
the O
north O
. O
Back O
to O
the O
south O
is O
the O
path O
leading O
down O
the O
hillside O
. O


The O
trail O
ends O
at O
a O
mound B-ART
of I-ART
dirt I-ART
piled O
two O
cubits B-ART
in O
height O
. O
This O
mound B-ART
serves O
as O
an O
earthen B-ART
altar I-ART

Behind O
the O
altar B-ART
the O
bush B-ART
grows O
thick O
. O


At O
one O
time O
, O
your O
apartment O
could O
have O
been O
featured O
on O
the O
cover O
of O
an O
IKEA O
catalogue O
, O
but O
your O
newly O
acquired O
pet O
has O
turned O
the O
decor O
into O
a O
disaster O
. O
Your O
bed B-ART
, I-ART
bookcase I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
coffee I-ART
table I-ART
are O
nearly O
destroyed O
, O
and O
a O
pile B-ART
of O
mangled O
CDs B-ART
lies O
near O
the O
mostly O
unscathed O
stereo B-ART
. O
Against O
one O
wall B-ART
is O
a O
small O
black O
refrigerator O
, O
and O
near O
it O
is O
the O
computer B-ART
that O
holds O
your O
thesis B-ART
. O
A O
sliding B-ART
glass I-ART
door I-ART
leads I-ART
south O
to O
your O
balcony O
and O
your O
front O
door B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
are O
atop O
the O
Eiffel O
Tower B-ART
. O
A O
small O
counter B-ART
can O
be O
seen O
with O
an O
orange B-ART
juice I-ART
dispenser I-ART
. O
A O
door O
leads O
east O
to O
the O
outer O
rail O
. O
The O
bathroom O
door O
is O
boarded O
up O
and O
a O
sign O
reads O
'Hold O
it O

' O


You O
feel O
on O
top O
of O
the O
world O
. O
Below O
you O
, O
and O
all O
around O
, O
are O
the O
ruins O
of O
Ancient B-ART
Paris I-ART
. O
The O
archaeological O
dig O
is O
doing O
marvelous O
work O
, O
and O
soon O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
see O
pretty O
much O
what O
the O
city B-ART
must O
have O
looked O
like O
several O
hundred O
years O
ago O
. O
Suspension B-ART
bridges B-ART
stream O
out O
from O
here O
to O
the O
various O
hovercraft O
that O
comprise O
the O
archaeological O
settlement O
Your O
quarters O
are O
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
to O
the O
north O
are O
the O
main O
offices O
. O
You O
can O
also O
go O
down O
to O
the O
main O
part O
of O
the O
dig O
. O


It's O
taken O
a O
lot O
of O
digging O
and O
laser O
blasting O
to O
get O
this O
far O
. O
The O
dust B-ART
is O
flying O
everywhere O
; O
a O
small O
room O
to O
the O
north O
has O
been O
uncovered O
recently O
, O
and O
while O
it O
would O
provide O
some O
shelter O
, O
you O
are O
unsure O
as O
to O
what O
its O
original O
function O
might O
be O
. O
You O
could O
, O
of O
course O
, O
climb O
back O
up O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
tower O
, O
above O
the O
flying O
dust B-ART
. O


The O
room O
is O
small O
, O
unlike O
what O
you O
have O
come O
to O
expect O
from O
previously O
uncovered O
rooms O
. O
A O
kind O
of O
bench B-ART
, O
about O
waist O
high O
, O
is O
against O
one O
wall B-ART
; O
above O
it O
is O
a O
rectangle B-ART
covered I-ART
over O
with O
a O
dustcloth B-ART
. O


Various O
holo B-ART
images I-ART
show O
interpretations O
of O
what O
Ancient O
Paris O
must O
have O
looked O
like O
; O
all O
of O
them O
include O
the O
Eiffel O
Tower O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
everything B-ART
. O
There O
are O
various O
pieces O
of O
equipment B-ART
, O
ranging O
from O
high O
tech O
to O
antiquated O
, O
lying O
around O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
suspension O
bridges O
lead O
south O
to O
the O
tower O
itself O
and O
southeast O
to O
your O
own O
quarters O
. O


You're O
on O
top O
of O
a O
tall O
tower B-ART
in O
Paris O
. O
You O
don't O
remember O
its O
name O
. O
Something O
is O
obviously O
very O
wrong O
. O


The O
field O
stretches O
all O
around O
you O
endlessly O
, O
or O
at O
least O
for O
a O
few O
feet O
, O
which O
is O
the O
extent O
of O
your O
vision O
. O
Being O
as O
close O
to O
the O
ground B-ART
as O
you O
are O
makes O
it O
difficult O
to O
see O
very O
far O
. O
The O
sky B-ART
reaches O
out B-ART
in O
all O
directions O
below O
you O
, O
the O
soft O
ground B-ART
and I-ART
grass I-ART
above O
you O
, O
which O
is O
an O
unfamiliar O
feeling O
for O
you O
, O
but O
then O
, O
you've O
never O
been O
stuck O
on O
your O
back O
like O
this O
before O
. O


The O
light O
of O
the O
Marquis O

spills O
out B-ART

Playbills B-ART
adorn O
the O
exterior O

some O

one O
in O

A O

The O

into O
a O
small O

A O
few O

push O
up O
through O
the O
concrete B-ART

and O
there O
is O
a O
wooden O
bench B-ART
for O

to O

. O
Streets B-ART
lead O
off O
the O
square B-ART
in O
many B-ART
directions O
, O
notably O
east O
where O
the O

. O


A O
dead O

along O
the O

of O
the O

of O
which O
lies O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O
The O
fire B-ART
escape I-ART
of O
the O
opposite O

casts O
a O
jagged O
shadow O
over O
the O
theatre B-ART
wall I-ART
and O
its O
solitary O
window B-ART
. O
The O
noise O
from O
theatre B-ART

Your O

I O
can O

the O

several O

I O
wouldn't O
expect O
to O
find O
a O

that O

the O

the O

you O

this O

quite O
a O
photo O
opportunity O

The O
dimmed B-ART
light I-ART

assorted I-ART
decorations I-ART
here O
were O
probably O
done O
to O
set O
a O
mysterious O
atmosphere O

you O
can O
never O
tell O
with O
people B-ART

famous B-ART

occasionally O

are O

you O
can O
see O
something O
of O
your O

the O
wood B-ART
stove I-ART

a O
window B-ART

A O
wierd O

smoke B-ART
covered O
the O
area O
, O
catching O
several O
hues B-ART
from O
an O
unknown O
light B-ART
source I-ART
. O
A O
charge O
was O
in O
the O
air O
, O
as O
if O
lightning B-ART
were O
about O
to O
strike O
. O
The O
hairs O
on O
the O
back O
of O
my O
neck O
were O
erect O

I O
had O
this O
terrible O
feeling O
that O
at O
any O
moment O
someone O
would O
wander O
up O
and O
ask O
me O
to O
dance O
. O


The O
beam B-ART
prevented O
me O
from O
moving O
It's O
like O
my O
brain O
was O
cut O
off O

I O

The O
queen O
sized O
double O
bed B-ART

a O

it's O
the O
only O
comfortable O

to O
sit O
on O

A O

I O

where O
I O
often O
spend O
time O

blank O
out O
my O

Sometimes O
it O
works O

far O
refrained O
from O
destroying O
it O
. O


I O
am O
by O
the O
only O
door B-ART
to O
my O
room O
. O
There O
is O
a O
large O
desk B-ART
beside O
the O
door B-ART
which O
I O
keep O
neurotically O
neat O
, O
not O
because O
I'm O
a O
particularly O
tidy O
person O
, O
more O
because O
Stinky O
the O
cat O
has O
a O
tendency B-ART
to O
willfully O
destroy O
anything B-ART
light O
enough O
to O
be O
manipulated O
by O
paws O
. O


I'm O
standing O
beside O
my O
window B-ART
. O
I O
often O
take O
breaks O
here O
, O
looking O
out O
onto O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
and O
strumming O
my O
guitar B-ART
. O
I O
suppose O
I O
should O
learn O
some O
songs O
someday O
. O


This O
is O
the O
top O
left O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
from O
the O
TV's O
perspective O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O
I've O
got O
a O
wardrobe B-ART
of O
some O
antiquity O
here O
which O
I O
use O
for O
the O
illicit O
purpose O
of O
hiding O
fashion O
crimes O
. O
It's O
quite O
a O
nice O
wardrobe B-ART
sort O
of O
1940s O
and O
itinerant O
. O


I O
am O
standing O
before O
a O
large O
bookcase B-ART
. O
A O
very O
large O
bookcase B-ART
. O
It O
towers O
over O
me O
, O
filled O
with O
my O
collection O
of O
literature O
. O
The O
spines O
of O
the O
books B-ART
look O
like O
an O
abstract O
picture O
composed O
of O
numerous O
, O
irregularly O
shaped O
rectangles O
. O


The O
queen O
sized O
double O
bed B-ART
takes O
a O
dominant O
position O
, O
mostly O
because O
it's O
the O
only O
comfortable O
thing O
to O
sit O
on O
. O


There O
is O
a O
large O
desk B-ART
beside O
the O
door B-ART

I O
keep O

because O

Leaves O
rustle O
in O
the O
spring O
breeze O
, O
and O
the O
soft O
calls O
of O
distant O
birds O
add O
a O
pleasant O
background O
. O
The O
barnyard O
is O
filled O
with O
muck B-ART
. O
Nearby O
, O
a O
splintery O
old O
post B-ART
juts O
from O
the O
mud B-ART
. O
A O
rusty O
old O
cowbell B-ART
hangs O
from O
the O

This O
clearing B-ART
used O
to O
be O
the O
site O
of O
a O
house B-ART
, O
where O
a O
team O
of O
scientists O
, O
who O
were O
studying O
the O
planet O
, O
lived O
. O
This O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
case O
, O
as O
the O
house B-ART
has O
burned O
down O
. O
The O
fire O
is O
probably O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
colony O
being O
out B-ART
of O
contact O
, O
but O
you O
are O
not O
sure O
it O
is O
the O
whole O
reason O
, O
as O
something O
does O
not O
feel O
right O
here O
. O
The O
ashes B-ART
from O
the O
house B-ART
cover O
the O
ground B-ART
, O
along O
with O
various O
twisted B-ART
metal I-ART
pieces I-ART
. O
Weeds B-ART
are O
popping O
up O
everywhere O
, O
as O
the O
jungle B-ART
reclaims O
the O
area O
. O
The O
clearing B-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
ruins I-ART
, O
continues O
to O
the O
north O
and O
west O
. O


The O
ashes B-ART
from O
the O
house B-ART
only O
cover O
a O
small O
segment O
of O
this O
corner B-ART
. O
Weeds B-ART
and I-ART
dirt I-ART
patches I-ART
cover O
most O
of O
the O
ground B-ART
instead O
, O
with O
what O
looks O
like O
the O
remains B-ART
of O
a O
garden B-ART
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
left O
to O
tell O
what O
was O
growing O
here O
before O
the O
fire O
, O
as O
any O
crops O
have O
completely O
disappeared O
. O
Maybe O
the O
scientists O
were O
not O
very O
good O
gardeners B-ART
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
crops O
. O
However O
, O
you O
think O
that O
this O
is O
unlikely O
, O
as O
the O
crops O
they O
use O
on O
new B-ART
colonies O
are O
virtually O
unkillable O
. O
The O
clearing B-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
ruins I-ART
, O
continues O
to O
the O
south O
and O
west O
. O


The O
ruins B-ART
continue O
in O
this O
corner B-ART
of O
the O
clearing B-ART
. O
A O
puddle B-ART
of I-ART
leaking I-ART
water I-ART
has O
formed O
in O
a O
hole B-ART
. O
It O
is O
probably O
where O
the O
water B-ART
storage O
for O
the O
kitchen O
and O
bathroom O
was O
located O
. O
It O
has O
been O
policy O
for O
water B-ART
to O
be O
brought O
in O
from O
off O
planet O
, O
since O
an O
unfortunate O
incident O
with O
an O
alien O
species O
that O
mainly O
consisted O
of O
water B-ART
. O
The O
wetness O
of O
the O
area O
seems O
to O
have O
protected O
the O
wood B-ART
a O
little O
better O
here O
than O
in O
the O
other O
corners B-ART
, O
with O
a O
few O
portions B-ART
lying O
on O
the O
ground B-ART
. O
The O
clearing B-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
ruins I-ART
, O
continues O
to O
the O
north O
and O
east O
. O


A O
large O
tree B-ART
dominates O
this O
section O
of O
the O
clearing B-ART
, O
with O
a O
low B-ART
hanging I-ART
, O
yet O
out B-ART
of O
reach O
, O
branch B-ART
above I-ART
where O
the O
house B-ART
used O
to O
be O
. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
just O
above B-ART
the O
roof O
of O
a O
one O
storey O
section O
of O
the O
house B-ART
. O
However O
, O
it O
is O
now O
only O
above B-ART
ashes I-ART
. O
This O
tree B-ART
must O
be O
tough O
and O
strong O
to O
have O
survived O
the O
chemical O
process O
used O
to O
create O
a O
clearing B-ART
. O
The O
chemicals O
are O
supposed O
to O
clear O
everything B-ART
in O
preparation O
for O
the O
houses B-ART
and I-ART
gardens I-ART
of O
any O
colonists O
. O
The O
clearing B-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
ruins I-ART
, O
continues O
to O
the O
south O
and O
east O
. O


This O
is O
the O
entrance B-ART
to O
Everett's O
place O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
a O
large O
passage O
to O
the O
dance O
floor O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
small O
, O
smooth O
walled O
room O
with O
barely O
enough O
area O
to O
stand O
. O
A O
pair O
of O
simple O
bunk B-ART
beds I-ART
occupy O
most O
of O
the O
cramped O
space O
. O
There O
is O
a O
panel B-ART
near O
the O
door B-ART
. O
A O
faint O
smell O
of O
ozone B-ART
is O
coming O
from O
the O
vent B-ART
high O
above B-ART
the O
beds B-ART
. O
The O
pirates O
must O
have O
started O
some O
electrical O
fires O
. O
The O
only O
door B-ART
is O
north O
, O
but O
it's O
closed O
and O
locked O
. O


It O
contains O
little O
more O
than O
a O
bed B-ART
, O
a O
closet O
and O
a O
PC O
. O


The O
lovely O
pink O
walls B-ART
of O
your O
bedroom O
reflect O
back O
the O
Little O
Mermaid O
nightlight O
you O
got O
when O
you O
were O
11 O
. O
The O
top O
of O
your O
dresser B-ART
is O
a O
mess O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
the O
papasan B-ART
chair I-ART
in O
the O
corner O
is O
piled O
high O
with O
your O
stuffed O
animals O
. O
The O
door O
to O
the O
south O
leads O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
house O

The O
bridge O
is O
bright O
and O
shiny O
. O
Buttons B-ART
and I-ART
dials I-ART
and O
flashing O
lights B-ART
adorn O
every O
surface B-ART
. O
In O
the O
middle O
is O
a O
chair B-ART
, O
on O
which O
sits O
the O
most O
hideous O
monster O
you O
have O
ever O
seen O
. O
A O
stairway O
leads O
back O
down O
to O
the O
hold O
, O
and O
there O
is O
an O
emergency O
escape O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
is O
your O
room O
. O
Well O
, O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
it's O
really O
more O
like O
a O
pit B-ART
. O
You O
sleep O
on O
a O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
moldy I-ART
animal O
pelts B-ART
, O
with O
the O
animals B-ART
still O
inside O
them O
. O
It O
ain't O
pleasant O
, O
but O
it's O
your O
home O
. O
Chet O
has O
rigged O
up O
a O
bell B-ART
here O
so O
he O
can O
ring O
it O
whenever O
he O
needs O
your O
assistance O
. O
A O
rickety B-ART
ladder I-ART
leads O
out O

The O
Royal O
Kitchen B-ART
is O
always O
higgeldy O
piggledy O
and O
today O
is O
no O
different O
. O
Chefs B-ART

You O

at O
the O

the O

which O
not O
as O

In O

It's O
a O
bit O
dark O
back O
here O

making O
it O
a O
challenege O
to O
walk O
from O
the O

without O

A O

against O
the O

The O
curtain B-ART

directly O

is O
the O
only O

that O

you O

There O

The O

very O
little O
along O

of O

as O
it's O
used O
by O
a O

each B-ART

Most O
of O
the O

up O

Your O

You O
recognize O
a O
voice O
from O
far O
away O
, O
Don't O
take O
that O
! O
Look O
in O
the O
cabin B-ART
at O
the O
stern O
you'll O
find O
some O
fun O
there O
! O
It O
sounds O
like O
Davis B-ART

Crash O
! O
You O
whirl O
around O
to O
see O
the O
door B-ART
shatter O
, O
kicked O
by O
a O
hulking O
man B-ART
, O
his O

You O
share O
your O
father's B-ART
stubborn O
streak O

I O
wished O
not O

this O

He O
leaps O
to O
your O

hauling O
you O
up O
onto O
his O

you O
out O

Captain B-ART

sets O
you O

You O
hear O
the O
large O
cupboard B-ART
scrape O
, O
and O
turn O
to O
see O
Captain O
Jamison B-ART
. O
Hello O
! O
I O
came O
down O
to O
give O
you O
this O
my O
allotment O
from O
the O
coffer O
. O
He O
nods O
at O
the O
box O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
Jamison B-ART
starts O
to O
pin O
a O
jewelled O
brooch O
on O
your O
clothes B-ART
, O
but O
, O
Devil O
take O
it O
, O
the O
clasp O
is O
broken O
. O
I'll O
have O
it O
repaired O
. O
He O
folds O
the O
pretty O
thing O
into O
your O
hand B-ART
. O
And O
I O
meant O
to O
reassure O
you O
that O
if O
the O
men B-ART
suddenly O
abandon O
ship B-ART
, O
they O
are O
off O
to O
help O
me O
. O
Rodney B-ART
will O
stay O
behind O
with O
you O
. O
He O
drops O
the O
coffer O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
smiling O
in O
farewell O
, O
and O
walks O
swiftly O
away O
. O


Your O
frock B-ART
suddenly O
catches O
on O
something O
, O
tearing O
the O
fabric O
. O
A O
large O
scrap O
flutters O
to O
your O
feet O
. O


You O
can O
see O
a O
rag B-ART
and O
a O
coffer B-ART
here O
. O


Suddenly O
you O
appreciate O
what O
it O
is O
to O
be O
a O
ball O
in O
an O
exploding O
cannon O
. O
The O
intense O
heat O
, O
the O
push O
of O
fire O
, O
and O
the O
sense O
of O
release O
when O
spit O
from O
the O
cannon's O
mouth B-ART
these O
you O
feel O
when O
the O
lighted B-ART
fuse O
finally O
burns O
up O
to O
the O
largest O
keg O
of O
gunpowder O
in O
the O
hold O
. O


You've O
got O
a O
bed B-ART
and O
a O
small B-ART
nightstand I-ART
here O
but O
not O
much O
else O
. O
It O
doesn't O
really O
look O
like O
your O
bedroom B-ART
, O
at O
least O
not O
the O
bedroom B-ART
that O
you O
have O
now O
. O
It O
reminds O
you O
of O
the O
bedroom B-ART
that O
you O
had O
as O
a O
kid O
. O
There O
are O
some O
posters B-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART
of I-ART
music I-ART
groups I-ART
and I-ART
sports I-ART
heroes I-ART
that O
you O
loved O
when O
you O
were O
were O
younger O
. O
There's O
a O
plain O
white O
door B-ART
set O
in O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
of O
the O

. O
The O
bathroom O
is O
just O
to O
the O
south O
and O
the O
kitchen O
is O
to O
the O
east O
. O


There's O
just O
a O
refrigerator B-ART
and O
a O
sink B-ART
set O
into O
the O
counter B-ART
. O
There O
are O
some O
dishes B-ART
on O
the O
kitchen O
counter B-ART
with O
what O
looks O
like O
the O
remains B-ART
of O
last O
night's O
dinner B-ART
. O
The O
bedroom O
is O
west O
from O
here O
and O
the O

is O
just O
to O
the O
south O
. O


This O
is O
the O
living O
room O
. O
It O
looks O
exactly O
the O
way O
you've O
always O
remembered O
it O
, O
except O
. O
. O
. O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
lacking O
most O
of O
the O
furniture O
you O
remember O
. O
There's O
a O
couch B-ART
, O
a O
coffee B-ART
table I-ART
, O
one O
photograph B-ART
on O
the O
wall O
and O
that's O
it O
. O
Surely O
it O
didn't O
always O
look O
like O
this O
. O
Wasn't O
there O
a O
TV O
and O
a O
fireplace O
and O
. O
. O
well O
. O
. O
. O
it O
was O
different O
wasn't O
it O
? O
North O
of O
the O
living O
room O
is O
the O
kitchen O
and O
to O
the O
west O
is O
the O
bathroom O
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
in O
open O
doorway B-ART
that O
shimmers O
and O
distorts O
the O
view O
of O
the O
street O
behind O
it O
. O


The O
bathroom O
is O
rather O
small B-ART
, O
like O
the O
other O
rooms O
in O
the O
house O
, O
and O
consists O
solely O
of O
a O
toilet B-ART
and O
a O
sink B-ART
. O
Your O
bedroom O
is O
north O
of O
here O
and O
the O
living O
room O
is O
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
room O
is O
small O
, O
but O
serviceable O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
devoid O
of O
any O
posters O
or O
pictures O
you O
keep O
meaning O
to O
put O
some O
up O
, O
but O
you O
never O
get O
around O
to O
it O
. O
It O
still O
looks O
lived O
in O
, O
though O
, O
which O
is O
a O
polite O
way O
of O
saying O
it's O
a O
mess O
. O
The O
door O
of O
your O
closet B-ART
doesn't O
quite O
open O
all O
the O
way O
because O
of O
the O
way O
the O
bed B-ART
is O
positioned O
, O
but O
what O
can O
you O
do O
? O
There O
was O
nowhere O
else O
to O
put O
it O
. O


You O
hear O
a O
message O
coming O
in O
on O
the O
official O

? O
I O
see O
you're O
in O
the O
middle O
of O

I O
just O
wanted O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
taking O
the O
time O
to O
check O
out O
the O

ah O
, O
potential O
effects O
of O
the O

Cleanliness O
. O
It's O
a O
minor O
thing O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but B-ART
you O
you O
know O
, O
well O
, O
actually O
, O
Dr O

Duncan O
did O
come O
down O
with O
food B-ART
poisoning O
just O
two B-ART
days O
ago O
and O
it O
made O
me O
realize O
but B-ART
I'm O
rambling O
, O
I'm O
sorry O
. O
I'll O
let O
you O
go O
, O
because O
I O
know O
it's O
so O
annoying O
when O
I'm O
using O
the O

Elm O
street O
passes O
under O
an O
elevated B-ART
roadway I-ART
, O
a O
relic O
of O
the O
last O
century's O
interstate O
highway O
system O
. O
A O
Chinese O
restaurant B-ART
fills O
the O
space O
under O
the O
highway O
to O
the O
south O
, O
and O
a O
bar B-ART
is O
nestled O
under O
the O
roadway B-ART
north O
of O
here O
. O
Elm O
leads O
eastward O
, O
to O
downtown B-ART
, O
and O
westward O
toward O
the O
suburbs B-ART
. O


This O
is O
a O
small O
Chinese O
restaurant O
, O
crowded O
with O
students B-ART
. O


This O
noisy O
lounge O
is O
a O
favorite O
hangout O
for O
students O
from O
the O
nearby O
college O
. O
Battered B-ART
wooden I-ART
stools I-ART
are O
the O
only O
seating O

The O
only O

You O
are O
at O
the O
north O
end O
of O
the O
market B-ART
of O
Alexandria O
, O
a O
large O
square B-ART
of O
brown O
dust O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
city O
. O
During O
the O
day O
, O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
with O
merchants O
displaying O
their O
goods O
on O
carts O
or O
rugs O
, O
buskers O
and O
customers O
. O
But O
now O
the O
sun O
is O
going O
down O
, O
and O
the O
place O
is O
almost O
completely O
deserted O
and O
all O
the O
storefronts B-ART
seem O
to O
be O
closed O
. O
The O
market B-ART
continues O
to O
the O
east O
, O
west O
and O
south O
, O
and O
the O
city's O
main B-ART
street I-ART
leads O
away O
to O
the O
north O
. O


The O
market O
continues O
to O
the O
west O
, O
north O
and O
south O
, O
and O
a O
dirty O
alley B-ART
leads O
to O
the O
east O
. O


This O
small B-ART
hotel O
has O
no O
doubt O
seen O
better O
days O
, O
but O
was O
never O
anything O
impressive O
, O
even O
in O
its O
prime O
. O
The O
front O
desk B-ART
, I-ART
vending I-ART
machine I-ART
and O
single O
couch B-ART
seem O
to O
jostle O
each B-ART
other O
for O
space O
in O
the O
tight O
confines O
of O
the O
lobby O
. O
A O
single O
bare O
bulb O
provides O
harsh O
lighting O
, O
and O
the O
ancient O
carpet B-ART
covering O
the O
floor O
is O
covered O
in O
all O
manner O
of O
stains B-ART
. O
Behind O
the O
front O
desk B-ART
, O
a O
narrow O
stairway B-ART
leads O
upstairs O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
narrow O
, O
dimly O
lit O
hallway O
, O
which O
gives O
access O
to O
the O
hotel's O
rooms O
all O
four B-ART
of O
them O
. O
The O
hallway O
is O
only O
about O
fifteen O
feet O
long O
, O
with O
two B-ART
doors I-ART
on O
either O
side O
. O
It O
terminates O
in O
a O
grimy B-ART
window I-ART
at O
one O
end O
and O
a O
stairway B-ART
down O
to O
the O
lobby O
at O
the O
other O
. O


The O
market O
continues O
to O
the O
east O
, O
north O
and O
south O
, O
and O
a O
dusty O
alley B-ART
leads O
to O
the O
west O
. O


This O
short O
, O
broad O
alley O
is O
dusty O
and O
dirty O
, O
but O
falls O
short O
of O
the O
degree O
of O
squalor O
usually O
found O
in O
alleys O
in O
this O
section O
of O
the O
city O
. O
The O
near O
total O
lack O
of O
litter O
and O
graffiti O
suggests O
that O
the O
city's O
public O
servants O
have O
recently O
sent O
a O
work O
gang O
of O
convicted O
criminals O
to O
clean O
the O
alley O
up O
. O
The O
buildings O
flanking O
the O
alley O
have O
wisely O
been O
constructed O
so O
as O
to O
have O
no O
ground O
floor O
windows B-ART
bordering O
on O
the O
alley O
; O
the O
lowest O
windows B-ART
are O
about O
fifteen O
feet O
off O
the O
ground O
. O
Stacked O
against O
one O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
alley O
is O
a O
neat O
pile O
of O
wooden B-ART
crates I-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
precariously O
at O
the O
very O
top O
of O
the O
pile O
of O
wooden O
crates O
, O
with O
the O
dusty O
floor O
of O
the O
alley O
over O
ten O
feet O
below O
you O
. O
Being O
up O
here O
puts O
you O
in O
easy O
reach O
of O
a O
small O
window B-ART
in O
the O
wall B-ART
of O
the O
north O
building O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
southwest O
corner O
of O
the O
market O
of O
Alexandria O
, O
a O
large O
square O
of O
brown O
dust O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
city O
. O
Nestled O
in O
a O
corner O
between O
buildings O
is O
an O
area O
floored O
with O
stone B-ART
tiles I-ART
. O
In O
the O
middle O
is O
a O
fountain B-ART
, O
which O
hasn't O
operated O
in O
as O
long O
as O
you O
can O
remember O
. O


It O
seems O
that O
not O
even O
Alexandria O
is O
immune O
to O
the O
urban O
decay O
which O
plagues O
all O
major O
cities O
. O
This O
alley O
is O
a O
testament O
to O
the O
darker O
side O
of O
urban O
life O
. O
Broken O
hypodermic B-ART
syringes B-ART
litter O
the O
ground O
, O
needles B-ART
gleaming O
dimly O
in O
the O
fading O
twilight O
, O
and O
strange O
graffiti B-ART
is O
scrawled O
on O
the O
walls B-ART
in O
flaking O
paint B-ART
. O


A O
large O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
garbage I-ART
bags I-ART
is O
stacked O
in O
a O
corner O
where O
the O
alley O
ends O
in O
a O
brick O
wall B-ART
. O


The O
market O
continues O
to O
the O
north O
, O
east O
and O
west O
and O
the O
city O
slums B-ART
lie O
to O
the O
south O
. O


Everything O
is O
in O
perfectly O
in O
order O
here O
white B-ART
and O
austere O
, O
as O
I O
like O
it O
. O
The O
door B-ART
to O
the O
hallway O
lies O
to O
the O
south O
, O
and O
windows B-ART
border I-ART
the O
other O
three O
sides O
of O
the O
room B-ART
. O


A O
tiny O
, O
dank O
space O
beyond O
my O
decorative O
abilities O
to O
remedy O
. O
Leo's O
painting B-ART
on O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
is O
just O
sufficiently O
distracting O
so O
that O
one O
might O
not O
notice O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
windows B-ART
, O
at O
least O
. O
The O
stairs O
down O
lie O
to O
the O
east O
, O
my O
bedroom O
is O
north O
, O
and O
the O
toilet O
is O
southwest O
. O


This O
is O
the O
landing O
of O
the O
stairwell B-ART
, O
which O
makes O
a O
broad O
180 O
degree O
turn O
between O
upstairs O
and O
downstairs O
. O
A O
wide O
shaft O
of O
morning O
sunlight B-ART
streams O
in O
through O
the O
picture B-ART
window I-ART
which O
makes O
up O
most O
of O
the O
eastern O
wall B-ART
, O
and O
the O
staircases B-ART
lie O
to O
the O
west O
. O


What O
until O
last O
week O
was O
my O
main O
living O
space O
is O
at O
the O
moment O
a O
complete O
disaster O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
painted O
a O
sickly O
turquoise B-ART
, O
new O
as O
of O
two O
days O
ago O
, O
and O
all O
the O
furniture B-ART
is O
still O
covered O
with O
plastic B-ART
. O
Currently O
the O
only O
thing O
I've O
put O
back O
up O
is O
another O
of O
Leo's O
paintings B-ART
, O
on O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
. O
The O
front O
door B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
southwest O
, O
the O
key B-ART
in O
the O
lock B-ART
. O
The O
stairs B-ART
up O
to O
the O
bedroom O
are O
to O
the O
east O
, O
the O
kitchen O
north O
. O


This O
room B-ART
also O
has O
windows B-ART
on O
three O
sides O
, O
and O
features O
splendid O
views O
of O
the O
garden O
and O
the O
pond B-ART
. O
Aside O
from O
the O
usual O
kitchen O
accessories B-ART
, O
I've O
got O
a O
little O
table B-ART
here O
, O
and O
some O
cabinets B-ART
. O


You're O
standing O
near O
the O
side B-ART
of O
a O
frozen B-ART
lake I-ART
. O
Boys B-ART
and I-ART
girls I-ART
from O
the O
village O
are O
ice O
skating O
on O
the O
lake B-ART
. O
A O
snow O
covered O
path O
leads O
northwest O
around O
the O
lake B-ART
and O
east O
into O
the O
village O
. O


Some O
ice B-ART
skates I-ART
, O
probably O
forgotten O
by O
someone O
, O
lie O
beneath B-ART
the O
old B-ART
willow I-ART

This O
is O
the O
place O
you O
have O
lived O
in O
for O
the O
last O
month O
and O
a O
bit O
. O
It O
was O
all O
you O
could O
afford O
with O
the O
small B-ART
pay O
you O
gleaned O
from O
countless O
rubbish O
jobs O
. O
Looking O
back O
, O
you O
should O
have O
looked O
harder B-ART
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
unpapered O
, O
the O
floor O
uncarpeted O
, O
and O
the O
room O
itself O
only O
contains O
a O
narrow B-ART
, I-ART
hard I-ART
bed I-ART
, O
a O
dresser B-ART
and O
a O
small B-ART
television I-ART
. O


The O
bathroom O
is O
long O
deserted O
. O
A O
urinal B-ART
stands O
in O
one O
corner O
; O
from O
the O
looks O
of O
it O
, O
Nostradamus O
himself B-ART
was O
likely O
the O
last O
person O
to O
use O
it O

The O

Every O
last O
inch O

the O

didn't O
pick O
up O
when O
Miss O

told O
them O
to O
pick O
up O
and O
now O
it's O
cluttered O
with O
gaudy O
plastic B-ART

The O
books B-ART
are O
tossed O
into O
the O
carpet B-ART
square I-ART
pile I-ART
and O
someone's O
dripped O
tempera B-ART
paint I-ART
onto O
every O
table B-ART

And O
there's O
more O

it O

every O

and O
you O
find O
yourself O

a O
difficult O

You O
are O

on O
your O
basic O
suburban B-ART

To O
the O

beyond O
a O

is O
the O

of O
your O
recently O
purchased O
white O
house O
, O
both B-ART
exactly O
like O
their O
counterparts O
on O
either O
side O

The O
bland O
sameness O
is O
enough O
to O
drive O
you O
stark O
raving O
bonkers O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
dark B-ART
alley I-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
garbage B-ART
bin I-ART
in O
front O
of O
you O

You O
don't O
bother B-ART
to O

Mrs O

You O
are O
seated O
at O
a O

your O

It's O
rather O
chilly O
at O
this O
time O
of O
night O
, O
and O
you O
would O

You O
can't O
seem O
to O
avoid O
the O
gaze O
of O
the O
carved B-ART
pumpkin I-ART
that O
sits O
here O

The O
jack B-ART

lantern B-ART
sits O

its O
evil O

Before O
you O
can O
do O
anything O
, O
the O
band B-ART
explodes O
into O
action O

The O
crowd O
coalesces O
into O
a O
single O
entity O
and O
leans O
towards O
them O
, O
falls O
back O
, O
ripples O
spastically O

Being O
part O

this O
lurching O
creature O
makes O
your O
spine O
tingle O

Your O

up O

A O

You O

quite O

what O
you O
were O
expecting O

sure O
, O
but O
not O
ten B-ART
thousand I-ART
people I-ART
crammed O
into O
a O
tenth B-ART

many B-ART
square O
feet O
until O
they O
ferment O
. O
They're O
sort O
of O
herded O
along O
by O
barriers B-ART

signs I-ART
, O
but O
once O
you O
reach O
critical O
mass B-ART
of O
a O
couple O
thousand B-ART
, O
it O
just O
looks O
like O
an O
enormous O
mass B-ART

Fortunately O
, O
you O
made O
it O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O

Unfortunately O

did O
Brody B-ART

A O
dark B-ART

rises O
high O
above O
you O

lit O
dimly O
in O
the O
cloud B-ART

The O
sound O
of O
a O
waterfall B-ART

nearby O
but O
somewhat O
muted O
by O
the O
high O
walls B-ART
of O
the O

To O
your O

is O
the O

the O

was O
built O
. O


Completely O
covered O
in O

the O

an O
enormous B-ART

A O

Although O
you're O
hiding O
as O
best O
as O
you O
can O
in O
the O

, O
it's O
dangerous O
to O
remain O
here O
long O
. O


Suddenly O
, O
the O
ship B-ART
lurches O
to O
one O
side O

throwing O
you O
off O

A O

eventually O
, O
seeing O
what O
you O
did O
to O
their O

gave O

up O

The O
lawn B-ART

southward O

Here O
, O
the O

a O

, O
book O
friendly O
haze B-ART
, O
through O
the O
curtains B-ART
. O
The O
only O
exit O
is O
a O
door B-ART
in O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
, O
which O
is O
otherwise O
bare O
except O
for O
a O
large O
painting B-ART
. O


The O
book O
on O
the O
round O
, O
maroon O
table O
is O
looking O
at O
you O
. O
In O
this O
sunny O
May O
afternoon O
, O
you O
wanted O
to O
read O
the O
book O
and O
be O
outside B-ART
also O
. O
So O
you O
took O
it O
and O
came O
to O
this O
coffee O
house O
. O
You O
are O
wondering O
what O
the O
protagonist O
will O
do O
next O
. O


The O
walls B-ART
are O
covered O
with O
posters B-ART
. O
A O
small B-ART
desk I-ART
stands O
next O
to O
the O
window B-ART
. O
It O
is O
half O
buried O
under O
piles B-ART
of I-ART
comics I-ART
, O
papers B-ART
and O
other O
stuff B-ART
. O
A O
large B-ART
white I-ART
cupboard I-ART
stands O
next O
to O
the O
door O
in O
the O
west O
wall B-ART
. O
Next O
to O
the O
pine B-ART
bed I-ART
is O
a O
nightstand B-ART
. O


A O
distant O
thud B-ART
outside O
your O
cell B-ART
brings O
you O
to O
your O
feet O
, O
cursing O
softly O
as O
you O
come O
up O
short B-ART
against I-ART
your O
chains B-ART
. O
From O
down O
the O
corridor O
you O
hear O
muffled O
voices B-ART
and O
the O
sounds O
of O
shuffling O
feet O
. O
There O
is O
a O
pause O
, O
silence O
, O
and O
you O
wait O
. O
Soon O
a O
brilliant O
glow O
appears O
, O
throwing B-ART
the O
bars B-ART
into O
stark O
relief O
, O
blinding O
you O
to O
what B-ART
lies I-ART
beyond O
. O
Squinting O
, O
you O
turn O
your O
head O
away O
, O
your O
eyes O
unaccustomed O
to O
the O
light B-ART
. O


There O
is O
little O
to O
see O
in O
the O
flickering O
light B-ART
stone B-ART
walls O
, O
a O
bare B-ART
dirt B-ART
floor O
, O
and O
a O
stout B-ART
friar I-ART
standing O
nervously O
before O
you O
. O


The O
room O
is O
frightfully O
dark B-ART
, O
save O
for O
pale O
streams O
of O
red O
light B-ART
shining O
through O
various O
holes B-ART
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
. O
Shadows B-ART
lurk O
around O
objects O
, O
forming O
vague O
outlines O
of O
unknown O
monstrosities B-ART
. O
There O
are O
no O
windows O
, O
just O
four B-ART
wooden I-ART
walls I-ART
around O
you O
, O
a O
weak O
fortress O
you O
hope O
will O
hold O
. O
And O
of O
course O
. O
. O
. O
the O
door B-ART
to O
the O
outside B-ART
. O


Soft O
cedar O
wood O
cushions O
your O
feet O
, O
as O
you O
stand O
in O
your O
bedroom B-ART
. O
Splendid O
is O
the O
only O
word O
that O
escapes O
your O
gate O
of O
teath O
. O
Your O
studies O
tell O
you O
that O
perfection O
is O
a O
fool's O
impossibility O
, O
but B-ART
this O
room O
is O
truly O
your O
paradise O
, O
refuge O
and O
sanctuary O
. O
A O
massive O
canopy B-ART
bed I-ART
clings O
to O
the O
southern O
wall O
, O
facing O
the O
door O
. O
Besides O
the O
bed B-ART
lies O
a O
a O
small O
drawer B-ART
, O
with O
a O
gas O
lamp O
sitting O
on O
it O
, O
just O
so O
. O
A O
small O
persian O
rug O
sits O
as O
an O
isolated O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
, O
taking O
away O
from O
its O
rather O
Spartanesque O
atmosphere O
that O
you O
love O
nevertheless O
. O


The O
bed B-ART
is O
quite O
comfy O
, O
as O
usual O
. O
The O
lamp O
is O
within O
an O
arm's O
reach O
. O


It's O
dark O
outside O
. O
A O
firm O
rain B-ART
is O
falling O
and O
the O
air O
is O
damp O
and O
misty O
. O
The O
road B-ART
continues O
north O
to O
the O
main B-ART
gate I-ART
and O
south O
back O
to O
the O
main B-ART

A O
small B-ART
path I-ART
goes O
east O
. O


You O
hide O
in O
the O
shadows O
of O
the O
trees O
beside O
the O
road B-ART
. O
Just O
ahead O
of O
you O
, O
to O
the O
north O
lies O
the O
main B-ART
gate I-ART
to O
Meramax O
. O
There O
are O
two O
armed B-ART
guards I-ART
outside O
the O
gate B-ART
and O
probably O
more O
of O
them O
in O
the O
small B-ART
building I-ART
next O
to O
it O
. O
The O
road B-ART
continues O
back O
to O
the O
south O
. O


It's O
very O
dark O
here O
. O
You O
can O
barely O
make O
out O
a O
small B-ART
shed I-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O
Beside O
the O
shed B-ART
is O
a O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
metal I-ART
junk I-ART
and O
next O
to O
that O
is O
a O
heap B-ART
of I-ART
sand I-ART
. O
The O
path B-ART
continues O
east O
, O
deeper O
into O
the O
forest B-ART
. O
The O
road O
that O
you O
came O
from O
is O
to O
the O
west O
. O


This O
was O
your O
private O
room O
until O
last O
Spring O
when O
Mommy O
brought O
home O
the O
new O
baby B-ART
from O
the O
hospital O

Now O
IT O
sleeps O
here O
too O
. O
One O
exit O

east O

leads O
into O
the O
hallway O
. O
Mommy O
told O
you O
to O
stay B-ART
here O
and O
take O
your O
nap O
. O
But O
she's O
downstairs O
taking O
her O
own O
nap O
, O
so O
you O
can O
do O
whatever O
you O
want O
. O

gate I-ART
across O
the O

protects O
you O

prevents O
you O

As O
dull O
a O
sight O
as O
that O
grey O
parking B-ART
lot I-ART
might O
be O
, O
you O
marvel O
at O
how O
many O

hours O
you've O
spent O
staring B-ART
at O
it O

this O

Your O

The O

, O
no O
more O
than O
two B-ART
meters O
on O

The O
ceiling B-ART
is O
so O
low O
that O
you O
must O
constantly O
stoop B-ART
to O
keep O
your O
head O
from O
brushing O
the O
mildewed O

The O

It's O
all O
prepared O
for O
you O
. O
The O
stage O
, O
so O
barren O
, O
lit O
only O
by O
the O
glow O
of O
the O
PowerPoint B-ART
above O
you O
and O
the O
backstage O
lights O
to O
the O
north O
. O
The O
audience B-ART
, O
south O
of O
you O
, O
doing O
their O
best O
to O
look O
rapt O
. O
And O
you O
, O
standing O
in O
the O
center O
of O
it O
all O
, O
small O
and O
curtailed B-ART
. O
After O
two B-ART
hours O

, O
it's O
seven B-ART
o'clock O
. O
Dinner O
was O
scheduled O
for O
6 O

. O
You O
have O
become O
irrelevant O
. O


You O
didn't O
really O
familiarize O
yourself B-ART
with O
the O
auditorium O
before O
going O
on O
stage O
. O
So O
all O
you O
see O
are O
doors O
arranged O
haphazardly O
and O
various O
other O
furniture B-ART
. O
All O
that O
you O
care O
about O
is O
the O
kitchen O
door O
to O
the O
west O
. O


This O
auditorium O
is O
apparently O
used O
for O
so O
many O
receptions O
, O
there's O
a O
built O
in O
kitchen O
. O
That's O
fine O
with O
you O
. O
You O
like O
convenience O
. O
It's O
got O
all O
the O
standard O
accoutrements O
dishwasher B-ART
, O
shelves B-ART
, I-ART
stove I-ART
, I-ART
sink I-ART
, I-ART
counter I-ART
. O
What O
it O
doesn't O
have O
is O
the O
kitchen O
staff O
that O
makes O
all O
of O
it O
useful O
. O


You O
are O
stood O
on O
a O
small O
country O
lane O
. O
The O
lane O
winds O
off O
east O
and O
northwest O
into O
the O
distance O
. O
Up O
on O
a O
hill O
to O
the O
southwest O
, O
you O
can O
see O
the O
outline B-ART
of O
the O
Abbey B-ART
what's O
left O
of O
it O
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
the O
entrance O
via O
the O
gate O
. O


This O
little O
garden O
seems O
quite O
claustrophobic O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
what O
you O
presume O
to O
be O
the O
front O
door B-ART
, O
with O
a O
conservatory B-ART
directly O
south O
. O
The O
path O
comes O
in O
from O
the O
road O
to O
the O
north O
and O
swings O
westward O
. O


This O
is O
a O
small O
path O
, O
running O
east O
to O
west O
. O
Trees B-ART
surround O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
path O
, O
but O
a O
shed B-ART
protrudes O
slightly O
from O
the O
south O
. O


You O
are O
stood O
at O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
graveyard B-ART
. O
The O
wrought O
iron O
railings O
stand O
tall O
to O
the O
east O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
which O
is O
a O
large O
open O
gateway O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
graveyard B-ART
extends O
westwards O
. O


This O
area O
of O
the O
graveyard B-ART
is O
fairly O
bare O
. O
There O
is O
a O
small O
patch O
of O
grass O
that O
has O
been O
dug O
up O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
a O
large O
gate O
taking O
you O
back O
to O
the O
house O
, O
and O
to O
the O
west O
is O
some O
sort O
of O
small O
building O
. O


You O
are O
stood O
in O
what O
looks O
like O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
graveyard B-ART
. O
To O
the O
west O
, O
you O
can O
see O
a O
large O
crypt O
rising O
before O
you O
. O
Back O
to O
the O
east O
is O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
graveyard B-ART
, O
and O
brambles O
and O
trees O
grow O
all O
around O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
ring B-ART
of O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
robot B-ART
boxing O
stadiums B-ART
in O
the O
entire O
world O
. O
Thousands O
of O
screaming O
fans B-ART
have O
packed O
the O
arena B-ART
to O
see O
your O
match O
. O
It's O
time O
for O
the O
fight O
to O
end O
it O
all O
. O


Your O
eyes O
try O
to O
focus O
on O
anything O
, O
but O
fail O
. O
There's O
nothing O
here O
but O
you O
. O
All O
you O
can O
see O
is O
static B-ART

It's O

A O

You O

a O

After O
all O

it's O
like O
Marx O
said O
It's O
one O
thing O

the O

In O

this O

a O

where O
the O
People's O
Committee B-ART
for O
the O
Revolution O
made O
their O
glorious O
plans O
to O
liberate O
all O
who O
are O

The O
red B-ART
light I-ART
that O
illuminates O
the O
room O
might O
cause O
eye O
strain O
and O
make O
it O
hard O
to O
work O
, O
but O
it O
is O
truly O
inspiring O
. O
You O
can O
exit O
the O
headquarters B-ART

how O
appropriate O

a O

You O
are O
standing O
in O
one O
of O
the O
few O
grassy O
places O
in O
Freedonia O
. O
The O
park O
is O
visited O
by O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
people B-ART
daily O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
in O
the O
exact O
center O

the O
city O

Roads O
lead O
in O
all O
four B-ART

You O

the O

A O
small O

dwarfed O
by O
the O
massive O

Freedonia O

Just O
being O

you O

You're O

Considering O
that O
the O
last O
time O
you O
were O
here O
you O
stole O
a O
desk O
from O
the O
basement O
, O
that O
isn't O
very O
surprising O

Since O
the O
elevators B-ART
are O
apparently O
inaccessible O

your O

There O

nothing O

Doorways B-ART

This O

Tiers O

You O
stand O
before O
the O

wondering O
if O
life O
would O
be O
worth O
living O
without O
Juliet B-ART
, O
your O
true O

The O
empty O

you O
, O
as O
if O
waiting O
for O
an O

You O
stand O
amid O
carnage O
, O
priests B-ART
killing O
people O
who O
watch O

! O


You're O
dozing O
comfortably O
in O
a O
deck B-ART
chair I-ART
out I-ART
on O
the O
ice B-ART
, O
the O
dome B-ART
wall I-ART
curving O
lazily O
away O
behind O
you O

Somehow O
the O
distant O
sun B-ART
is O
still O
warm O
on O
your O

Jupiter B-ART
leers O
over O
the O
horizon B-ART

You're O
out B-ART
on O
the O
ice B-ART
fields O
in O
an O
old O
rover B-ART
. O
In O
the O
darkness O
, O
the O
headlamps B-ART
throw O
back O
blinding O
flashes O
of O
light O
from O
the O
crystalline O
surface B-ART
. O


The O
red O
emergency B-ART
light I-ART
makes O
everything B-ART
seem O
molten O
hot O
. O
Mist B-ART
is O
swirling O
into O
the O
cabin O
from O
somewhere O
, O
making O
it O
hard O
to O
see O
. O


The O
view B-ART
onto O
the O
water B-ART
is O
great O
, O
and O
you're O
looking O
forward O
to O
seeing O
the O
fireworks B-ART
at O
midnight O
. O
You O
can O
walk O
towards O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
roof B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


You're O
clinging O
to O
the O
side O
of O
the O
chimney B-ART
. O
From O
here O
you O
can O
go O
down O
to O
the O
rooftop O
or O
attempt O
to O
climb O
further O
up O
the O
top B-ART
of O
the O
chimney B-ART
. O


A O
brick B-ART
chimney I-ART
looms O
above O
you O
. O
You're O
at O
the O
southeast O
corner B-ART
of O
the O
square O
rooftop B-ART
the O
door B-ART
you O
came O
out B-ART
of O
is O
to O
the O
west O
, O
an O
overgrown O
garden B-ART
patch I-ART
is O
to O
the O
northwest O
. O
You O
can O
also O
go O
north O
, O
though O
there's O
nothing O
that O
interesting O
there O
. O


To O
the O
west O
you O
can O
see O
a O
nearby B-ART
building I-ART
, O
about O
the O
same O
height O
as O
the O
one O
you're O
on O
. O


There's O
a O
great O
view B-ART
of O
the O
city B-ART
from O
here O
from O
this O
distance O
, O
if O
you O
squint O
, O
you O
can't O
really O
tell O
most O
of O
the O
buildings O
have O
been O
stripped O
and O
abandoned O
. O
You O
know O
that's O
why O
Anton's B-ART
always O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
guys O
to O
collect O
up O
on O
the O
rooftops B-ART
, O
even O
though O
they've O
mostly O
been O
picked O
clean O
years O
ago O
so O
he O
can O
stare O
at O
his O
precious O
Tower B-ART
. O


Like O
a O
lot O
of O
buildings O
renovated O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
it's O
got O
a O
small O
garden B-ART
patch I-ART
. O
Fifty O
years O
later O
, O
it's O
still O
doing O
its O
best O
to O
hide O
the O
grey O
concrete O
and O
metal O
beneath O
. O
But O
it O
comes O
off O
as O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
green O
toupee O
in O
comparison O
to O
the O
entirely O
organic O
, O
silk O
lined O
wooden O
skyscrapers B-ART
they're O
building O
today O
in O
Mumbai O
and O
Shanghai O
. O


How O
do O
you O
know O
it's O
the O
7th O
room B-ART
? O
You O
just O
do O
. O


This O
is O
where O
you O
live O
. O
It's O
about O
the O
only O
place B-ART
in O
the O
castle O
where O
the O
rain O
doesn't O
get O
in O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
are O
black O
shapes O
around O
you O
. O
To O
the O
north O
lies O
the O
courtyard O
. O


Around O
you O
the O
walls B-ART
, O
or O
rather O
, O
what's O
left O
of O
them O
, O
rest O
silently O
in O
the O
darkness O
. O
Gaping O
holes B-ART
mark O
the O
places O
where O
the O
windows O
used O
to O
be O
. O
To O
the O
south O
you O
can O
barely O
make O
out O
the O
round B-ART
tower I-ART
, O
and O
only O
guess O
where O
the O
entrance O
lies O
. O
A O
black O
hole O
in O
one O
corner O
of O
the O
courtyard O
leads O
down O
and O
to O
the O
west O
, O
beyond O
the O
castle's O
gate O
, O
a O
hill B-ART
slopes O
upward O
. O


The O
hill B-ART
looms O
black O
to O
the O
west O
. O
To O
the O
east O
you O
see O
the O
dark O
walls B-ART
of O
the O
castle B-ART
. O
The O
black O
surface O
of O
Loch B-ART
Awe I-ART
stretches O
to O
the O
southeast O
as O
far O
as O
you O
can O
see O
. O


The O
country O
stretches O
dark O
and O
silent O
around O
you O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
the O
castle B-ART
and I-ART
Loch I-ART
Awe I-ART
lies O
asleep O
far O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


You O
can O
see O
are O
an O
old O
altar B-ART
in O
one O
corner O
, O
which O
is O
poorly O
lit O
by O
some O
candles B-ART
, O
and O
the O
light O
square O
in O
the O
ceiling B-ART
, O
where O
the O
stair B-ART
leads O
up O
into O
the O
courtyard O
. O
The O
rest O
is O
darkness O

The O
lake B-ART

before O
you O

To O
the O
north O
, O
the O
castle B-ART
walls I-ART
loom O
above O
you O
, O
to O
the O
northwest O
the O
hill B-ART
slopes O
upwards O
. O


Except O
that O
it's O
a O
train O
car B-ART
, O
not O
a O
room O
. O
And O
the O
bunks B-ART
are O
built O
into O
the O
walls B-ART
. O
I O
think O
they O
fold O
up O
, O
maybe O
. O
You O
can't O
see O
any O
TV O
cameras B-ART
, O
but O
you O
know O
they're O
there O
. O
There O
are O
other O
cars B-ART
to O
the O
north O

This O
car B-ART
has O
little O
booths B-ART
with O
benches B-ART
and I-ART
tables I-ART
for O
people O
to O
eat O
at O
. O
It O
must O
not O
be O
mealtime O
, O
because O
there's O
no O
one O
here O
to O
serve O
you O
. O
There O
are O
doors O
to O
the O
north O

south O
, O
leading O
to O
other O

. O


This O
cargo O
car O
is O
filled O
with O
heavy B-ART
iron I-ART
boxes I-ART
. O
Each B-ART
box O
is O
chained B-ART
to O
the O
walls B-ART
, O
and O
most O
of O
them O
are O
locked B-ART
tight O
. O


It's O
the O
end O
of O
the O
line O
! O
That's O
railroad O

This O
caboose B-ART
is O
just O
a O
little B-ART
car O
, O
open O
to O
the O
fresh O

A O
railing O
keeps O
you O
from O
falling O
off O
the O

You O
can O
go O
back O
into O
the O
regular O
cars O
to O
the O
north O

You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
cargo O
hold O
of O
your O

the O
powerful O

An O

an O

showing O

leads O
northeast O
out O

You O
find O
yourself O

Apart O

most O

a O

up O
to O
the O

to O
a O
prominent O

some O

east O

The O
ground O
underfoot O
is O
remarkably O
spongy O

almost O
as O
if O
a O

lay O
below O

Indeed O
, O
your O

make O
faint O
'Boing O

as O
you O
walk O

The O
spongy O
area O
continues O
eastward O
along O
the O

This O

a O
richly O

can't O
even O
tell O
how O
long O
you O
slept O
, O
and O
you're O
not O
fully O
awake O
anyway O
; O
all O
you O
can O
focus O
on O
is O
the O
bathroom B-ART
door I-ART
and O
a O
patch O
of O
stars B-ART
through O
the O
window B-ART
. O


The O
bathroom B-ART
is O
small O
enough O
to O
give O
anyone O
claustrophobia O
, O
but O
the O
wall B-ART
sized O
mirror B-ART
and O
white O
furnishings B-ART
work O
together O
to O
improve O
things O
. O


After O
weeks O
on O
the O
ship O
, O
you O
know O
this O
cabin B-ART
by O
heart O
the O
oddly O
shaped O
mythyan O
bed B-ART
, O
the O
sitting O
cushions B-ART
around O
the O
low O
table B-ART
and O
the O
generous B-ART
window I-ART
above I-ART
it O
. O
All O
round O
edges O
and O
soft O
colors O
. O
Automatic B-ART
doors I-ART
lead O
to O
the O
bathroom B-ART
and I-ART
outside I-ART
, O
respectively O
. O


This O
platform O
aft B-ART
of O
the O
ship's O
lounge B-ART
commands O
an O
ample O
view O
of O
the O
cargo B-ART
deck I-ART
. O
Stairs O
lead O
up O
and O
down O
, O
while O
two B-ART
galleries O
curve O
backwards O
towards O
port B-ART
and I-ART
starboard I-ART
. O


The O
galactic B-ART
ocean I-ART
raises O
majestically O
in O
front O
of O
you O
, O
splashing O
a O
million O
drops O
of O
light B-ART
against O
the O
crystal B-ART
arch I-ART
that O
is O
the O
bridge B-ART
window I-ART
. O
From O
a O
small O
podium B-ART
against O
the O
far O
wall B-ART
, O
the O
Captain's B-ART
seat B-ART
dominates O
the O
room O
. O
On O
the O
sides O
, O
the O
comm B-ART
and I-ART
helm I-ART
consoles I-ART
patiently O
await O
their O
operators O
. O


Many O
a O
times O
you O
have O
lingered O
here O
, O
digging O
through O
the O
library B-ART
, O
listening O
to O
music O
or O
just O
lying O
on O
a O
couch B-ART
and O
watching O
the O
stars B-ART
go O
by O
at O
warp O
speed O
. O
And O
after B-ART
all O
those O
dinners O
with O
the O
captain O
, O
you O
still O
can't O
handle O
the O
replicator B-ART
properly O
. O


A O
short O
gallery O
runs O
fore B-ART
and I-ART
aft I-ART
, O
curving O
high O
above B-ART
the O
ship's O
cargo B-ART
deck I-ART
and O
under O
an O
oppressingly O
low O
ceiling B-ART
. O
The O
four B-ART
crewman's O
cabins O
are O
lined O
up O
on O
the O
port B-ART
side O
; O
one O
of O
the O
doors B-ART
seems O
to O
be O
unlocked O
. O


A O
hundred O
tons O
of O
cargo O
would O
not O
crowd O
this O
place O
too O
much O
, O
but O
empty O
as O
it O
is O
now O
, O
it O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you're O
in O
the O
belly O
of O
some O
metal O
whale O
. O
The O
transporter's B-ART
alcove B-ART
takes O
up O
one O
side O
, O
leaving O
the O
other O
to O
an O
airlock B-ART
and O
its O
antechamber B-ART
. O
A O
flight O
of O
stairs O
nonchalantly O
climbs O
to O
the O
middle O
deck O
. O


About O
half O
a O
dozen O
spacesuits B-ART
are O
packed O
in O
their O
racks O
along O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
together O
with O
other O
gear O
that O
might O
prove O
useful O
to O
a O
landing O
party O
. O


At O
its O
top O
, O
the O
ramp B-ART
ends O
in O
a O
short O
, O
wide O
room O
, O
compressed O
between O
two B-ART
archways I-ART
. O
The O
front O
one O
is O
meant O
to O
generate O
an O
atmospheric B-ART
force B-ART
field I-ART
, O
thus O
allowing O
the O
ramp B-ART
to O
open O
up O
in O
space O

Your O

Mother O

the O

You O
prefer O
to O
think O
about O
your O
safehouse O
as O
a O
collection O
of O

so O
as O
not O

Heavy O
layers O
of O

the O
huge O

It's O
oppressive O

Your O

sitting O
at O
the O
blackjack B-ART

here O

the O

A O

It's O
a O

Around O

Oh O

Happy O

As O
a O

your O

you O

What's O
the O
most O
beautiful O
part O
of O
country O
living O

The O
trees O

The O
fields O
? O
The O
dead O

in O
the O

stinking O

The O

There's O
a O
school O
to O
the O
east O

You O
stand O
in O
the O
parking O
lot O
behind B-ART
the O
high O
school B-ART
, O
near O
the O
huge B-ART
billboard I-ART
that O
proudly O
proclaims O
the O
school's B-ART
motto B-ART
. O
You O
think O
to O
yourself O
a O
small O
town O
public O
high O
school B-ART
, O
a O
full O
moon O
rising O
, O
and O
me O
an O
undead O

brained O
maniac O
. O
. O
. O
ah O
, O
gee O
, O
hope O
nothing O
kooky O
happens O
. O
There's O
a O
road O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
the O
school's B-ART
rather O
flimsy O
looking O
back B-ART
door I-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


There O
is O
a O
knock O
at O
the O
door B-ART
of O
your O
office O

Without O
waiting O
for O
an O
answer O
, O
the O
Dean O
of O
the O

walks O
into O
your O
working O
quarters O
, O
followed O
by O
three B-ART
gentlemen O
sharply O
dressed O
in O
charcoal O
suits B-ART

You O
are O
in O
your O
messy O
office B-ART
, O
where O
you O
end O
up O
spending O
most O
of O
your O
time O
here O
at O
the O
university O
. O
A O
dusty O
window B-ART
looks O
out O
over O
other O
buildings O
that O
constitute O
the O

of O
University O
Boheme O

To O
the O
south O
, O
your O
office B-ART
door I-ART
is O
cracked O
open O
a O
few O
inches O
, O
and O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
occasional O
footsteps O
of O
a O
student O
or O
faculty O
member O
as O
they O
walk O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
hallway O

You O
are O
at O
the O
west O
end O
of O
a O
long O
, O
dark O
hallway O
with O
obtrusive O
shadows O
upon O
the O
walls B-ART
from O
the O
students O
who O
lurk O
at O
the O
far O
end O
of O
the O
hall O
. O
Their O
presence O
is O
stifling O
this O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
you O
hope O
to O
get O
the O
bulk O
of O
your O
day's O
work O
done O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
today's O
task O
is O
different O

a O
missing O
man O
. O
Ironically O
, O
as O
an O
academic O
in O
the O
nascent O
field O
of O
psychology O
, O
you O
have O
always O
considered O
yourself O
on O
a O
search O
for O
that O
which O
man O
is O
missing O
. O
Your O
office O
is O
to O
the O

the O

The O

Intricate B-ART
carvings I-ART
dominate O
the O

The O
spirits B-ART
of O
your O

cry O
out B-ART
to O
you O
from O
the O
formica B-ART
. O
You O
hold O
back O
your O
tears O
. O
It O
is O
the O
time O
of O
testing O

You O
must O
be O
a O
man O

Newly O
fallen O
snow B-ART
sits O
gently O
on O
the O
roof O

Nearby O
, O
you O
spot O
a O
chimney B-ART
you O
can O
climb O
down O
. O


Everything O
about O
this O
place O
gives O
you O
a O
headache O
the O
fluorescent B-ART
lights B-ART
reflecting O
off O
the O
polished O
faux B-ART
marble I-ART
flooring B-ART
, O
the O
greasy O
funk O
of O
the O
food O
court O
, O
the O
echoes O
of O
screaming O
children B-ART
and O
Christmas O
music O
piped O
through O
tinny O
speakers B-ART

You O
have O
got O
to O
get O
out B-ART

here O

Something O
about O
the O
10 O
foot O
tall O
hedges B-ART
and O
the O
squishy O
, O
padded O
astroturf B-ART
under O
your O
feet O
has O
transported O
you O
away O
from O
the O
migraine O
inducing O
chaos O
of O
the O
mall O
. O
But O
now O
the O
narrow O
pathways B-ART
and O
tall O
hedges B-ART
make O
you O
feel O
antsy O
and O
claustrophobic O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
snowy B-ART
intersection O
of O
several O
narrow O
passages O
. O


A O
small O
army B-ART
of O
animatronic O
elves B-ART
stands O
immobile O
amidst O
an O
array O
of O
silent O
toy O
producing O
machines B-ART
. O
Dressed O
in O
festive O
red B-ART
and I-ART
green I-ART
aprons I-ART
, O
clenching O
mallets B-ART
and I-ART
bellows I-ART
and O
hand O
powered B-ART
drills B-ART
, O
they O
are O
Santa's O
sweatshop O
workforce B-ART
although O
you O
wonder O
how O
much O
sweating O
one O
does O
at O
the O
North O
Pole O
, O
and O
then O
remind O
yourself B-ART
that O
these O
are O
animatronic O
elves B-ART
who O
wouldn't O
sweat O
anyhow O
, O
and O
besides O
even O
if O
they O
could O
sweat O
they're O
just O
standing O
there O
not O
moving O
or O
anything O
at O
the O
moment O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
narrow O
, O
snowy B-ART
intersection O
of O
several O
passages O
. O


You've O
worked O
your O
way O
pretty O
deep O
into O
the O
tunnel B-ART
and O
it O
is O
really O
too O
dark O
to O
see O
anything O
. O
The O
opening O
of O
the O
tunnel B-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
light O
filters O
in O
from O
the O
mall O
, O
but O
just O
enough O
for O
you O
to O
find O
your O
way O
back O
out B-ART
. O


This O
was O
the O
break O
room O
for O
the O
Santaland O
elves O
meaning O
the O
human O
teenagers O
who O
worked O
here O
in O
Santaland O
during O
their O
winter O
breaks O
from O
school O
. O
Once O
, O
this O
might O
have O
been O
an O
okay O
place O
to O
hang O
out B-ART
with O
your O
fellow O
slackers O
and O
talk O
about O
how O
lame O
all O
of O
this O
Santaland O
junk B-ART
is O
, O
but O
now O
the O
room O
has O
been O
trashed B-ART
, O
even O
by O
teenage O
slacker O
standards O
. O


There O
are O
doors B-ART
to O
the O
south O
, O
the O
west O
, O
and O
the O
southwest O

You O
are O
in O
a O
wider O
, O
more O
spacious O
bedroom O
, O
with O
sunlight O
streaming O
in O
through O
the O
windows B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
cluttered O
desk B-ART
with O
a O
Macintosh B-ART

There O
are O
a O
number O
of O

on O
the O

A O
door O
to O
the O

to O
the O

You O
are O
inside O
one O
of O
the O
entryways O
in O
Holder O

a O
lovely O
gothic O
dorm O

In O
several O
places O
the O
wooden B-ART
panelling B-ART
that O
covers O
the O
wall B-ART
has O
been O
punched O
away O
, O
revealing O
the O
ugly O
concrete B-ART
surface O
behind O
it O
. O
To O
the O
northeast O
is O
the O
entrance O
to O
21 O

A O

You O
are O
in O
the O
common O
room O
of O
22 O
Holder O
Hall O
. O
It's O
just O
as O
messy B-ART
as O
21 O
Holder O
, O
but O
the O
mess B-ART
seems O
more O
delicate O
somehow O
clearly O
, O
it O
has O
a O
feminine O
touch O
. O
Doorways B-ART
south O

west O
lead O
into O
the O
bedrooms O
, O
and O
you O
can O
exit O
the O

the O
southwest O

This O
is O
Lisa O
and O
Ashley's O
room O
. O
For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it's O
identical O
to O
the O
small O
bedroom O
in O
21 O
Holder O
; O
it O
is O
just O
as O
cramped O
, O
and O
just O
as O
dark O
. O
The O
only O
difference O
is O
a O
dearth B-ART
of I-ART
posters I-ART
of I-ART
scantily I-ART
clad I-ART
females I-ART
. O


This O
is O
Whitney O
and O
Melisande's O
room O

It's O
one O
of O
those O
rooms O
you O
sometimes O
see O
in O
adventure O
games B-ART
that O
was O
put O
in O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
completeness O
, O
but O
doesn't O
really O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
the O
story O
. O


West O
is O
the O
wall B-ART
of O
the O

Most O
of O
the O

In O

there O
are O
thick B-ART

of O
the O

Up O
here O
the O
female O

Now O
there O
is O

very O
young O

that O
you O
used O

a O
gleaming B-ART

Calling O
your O
living O
quarters O
modest O
would O
be O
an O
insult O
to O
modesty O
. O
Sometimes O
when O
looking O
at O
your O
bare B-ART
room O
and O
tiny O
bed B-ART
you O
wonder O
about O
your O
choice O
to O
set O
up O
in O
London O
as O
a O
tradesman O
, O
but O
then O
the O
excitement O
of O
the O
scene O
in O
which O
you O
move O
reminds O
you O
that O
financial O
prosperity O
is O
not O
everything O
. O
Other O
than O
the O
bed B-ART
the O
room O
contains O
only O
the O
bare B-ART
necessities I-ART
of O
living O
. O
To O
the O
east O
is O
your O
workroom O
. O


Your O
modest O
place O
of O
business B-ART
is O
dominated O
by O
your O
printing B-ART
press I-ART
, O
a O
large O
contraption O
of O
wood O
, O
metal O
, O
and O
stone B-ART
standing O
in O
a O
place O
of O
honor O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Surrounding O
it O
are O
its O
attendants O
a O
drying B-ART
rack I-ART
, O
a O
few O
large O
boxes B-ART
of I-ART
movable I-ART
type I-ART
, O
several O
stacks B-ART
of I-ART
blank I-ART
paper I-ART

buckets I-ART
of I-ART

water I-ART
with O

Between O
the O
encroaching O
Plague O
and O
the O
typical O
bleak O
London O
winter O
most O
readers O
have O
abandoned O
the O
city O
for O
more O
hospitable O
climes O
. O
There O
is O
therefore O
little O
business B-ART
for O
your O
trade O
right O
now O
, O
but O
all O
stands O
ready O
in O
hopeful O
anticipation O
. O
Your O
tiny O
bedroom O
lies O
to O
the O
west O
, O
the O
door B-ART
to O
the O
street O
to O
the O
north O
. O


You O
stand O
near O
the O
Thames B-ART
in O
Blackfriars O
, O
just O
north O
of O
your O
modest O
printworks B-ART
. O
The O
narrow O
street O
, O
running O
east O
toward O
London O
Bridge O
and O
west O
in O
parallel O
with O
the O
river B-ART
, O
is O
somewhat O
crowded B-ART
but O
perhaps O
a O
bit O
quieter O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
most O
of O
the O
surrounding O
buildings B-ART
are O
shut O
up O
tight O
. O
A O
small O
but O
nevertheless O
disturbing O
number O
of O
their O
doorways B-ART
are O
marked O
with O
crudely O
painted O
red B-ART
crosses I-ART
. O


You O
stand O
before O
the O
only O
bridge B-ART
across O
the O
Thames B-ART
, O
which O
seems O
to O
fairly O
bend O
in O
the O
middle O
under O
the O
sheer O
mass O
of O
humanity B-ART
that O
throngs O
upon O
it O
. O


You O
stand O
on O
London O
Bridge B-ART
amidst O
the O
densest O
collection O
of O
humanity B-ART
to O
be O
found O
anywhere O
in O
England O
. O
You O
get O
no O
more O
than O
an O
occasional O
glimpse O
of O
the O
Thames B-ART
through O
gaps O
in O
the O
shops B-ART
crowding I-ART
either O
side O
of O
the O
narrow O
roadway O
. O
The O
buildings B-ART
rise O
far O
above O
your O
head O
, O
and O
are O
often O
connected O
at O
their O
tops O
by O
bridged B-ART
walkways B-ART
. O
The O
overall O
effect O
is O
more O
akin O
to O
passing O
through O
a O
tunnel O
than O
crossing O
a O
bridge B-ART
. O
And O
then O
there O
are O
the O
people B-ART
crowding I-ART
the O
road O
as O
well O
as O
every O
nook O
and O
crevice O
off O
it O
, O
and O
making O
forward O
motion O
an O
exercise O
in O
patient O
near O
futility O
. O


The O
southern O
end O
of O
London O
Bridge B-ART
is O
dominated O
by O
a O
massive O
gatehouse B-ART
. O
Impaled O
upon O
the O
spikes B-ART
of O
the O
open O
gate B-ART
are O
the O
severed B-ART
heads I-ART
of O
criminals O
, O
a O
spectacle B-ART
to O
which O
the O
populace O
barely O
spares O
a O
glance O
. O
To O
the O
east O
stands O
the O
almost O
equally O
grim O
facade O
of O
Marshalsea B-ART
Prison B-ART
, O
while O
Stoney O
Street O
parallels O
the O
riverbank B-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O


You O
stand O
atop O
the O
kitchen O
bench O
, O
surveying O
what O
was O
once O
a O
happy O
home O
, O
but O
now O
seems O
full O
of O
terror O
. O
Your O
family O
toaster B-ART
stands O
before O
you O
, O
chrome O
faintly O
glimmering O
through O
years O
of O
baked O
on O
grime O
. O
A O
precipitous O
drop O
to O
the O
south O
overshadows O
the O
hard O
, O
tiled O
floor O
. O
To O
the O
east O
lies O
the O
sink B-ART
, O
with O
its O
unwashed O
dishes B-ART
appearing O
more O
menacing O
by O
the O
moment O
. O
Beyond O
the O
sink B-ART
you O
can O
see O
the O
phone B-ART
perhaps O
your O
only O
chance O
to O
seek O
help O
. O


You O
can O
see O
a O
dresser B-ART
and O
a O
vanity B-ART
here O
. O


You O
stand O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
steep O
hill B-ART
that O
slopes O
upwards O
. O


Count O
Ruggino's O
house B-ART
lours O
in O
the O
dim O
air O
like O
a O
gathering O
of O
gravestones O
. O
The O
road O
makes O
a O
circle O
before O
it O
, O
then O
runs O
north O
back O
to O
Firenze O
. O


Your O
office O
is O
clean O
and O
tidy O
, O
just O
the O
way O
you O
like O
it O
. O
Fastened O
to O
your O
desk B-ART
is O
a O
name O
plate O
, O
which O
reads O
Agent O
Socks O
Molder O
, O
Paranormal O
Investigation O
. O
The O
main O
room O
of O
the O
Police O
Station O
is O
to O
the O
east O
. O


The O
bubble O
cockpit O
is O
as O
cold O
, O
sterile O
, O
and O
boring O
as O
ever O
. O
The O
view O
of O
the O
stars B-ART
is O
less O
overwhelming O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be O
now O
they're O
mostly O
just O
boring O
to O
look O
at O
. O
You O
check O
your O
console B-ART
one O
last O
time O
. O
Everything's B-ART
set O
, O
you O
can O
wake O
up O
your O
replacement O
whenever O
you O
want O
to O
. O


As O
with O
everything B-ART
else O
onboard O
, O
the O
sick O
bay O
is O
underwhelming O
. O
It's O
a O
small O
room O
with O
a O
med O
bed O
and O
a O
bulky O
set O
of O
scanners O
and O
robotic O
arms O
. O
Going O
under O
the O
knife O
here O
would O
be O
truly O
unpleasant O
. O


You O
hear O
the O
drone O
of O
bees B-ART
. O
They O
don't O
scare O
you O
as O
much O
as O
they O
used O
to O
. O
One O
stung O
you O
, O
and O
it O
wasn't O
the O
end O
of O
the O
world O
. O
You O
learned O
to O
stand O
still O
without O
freezing O
up O
, O
but O
when O
you O
said O
there O
was O
a O
deeper O
lesson O
, O
someone O
laughed O
at O
you O
. O
You O
wonder O
now O
how O
you O
could've O
held O
your O
ground O
a O
bit O
better O
, O
or O
if O
you'll O
get O
the O
chance O
again O
. O


This O
looks O
like O
the O
sort O
of O
place O
where O
couples O
go O
to O
make O
out B-ART
. O
Big O
grown O
up O
high O
school O
couples O
, O
you O
once O
thought B-ART
. O
But O
you're O
in O
college O
now O
and O
know O
they O
usually O
embellished O
the O
fun O
times O
here O
. O


There's O
not O
much O
here O
in O
Cadet B-ART
Space I-ART
, O
just O
a O
cots B-ART
mass B-ART
. O
Well O
, O
there's O
a O
pocket B-ART
sewn O
into O
the O
east O
wall B-ART
. O


A O
massive B-ART
cedar I-ART
desk I-ART
, I-ART
well I-ART
polished I-ART
and I-ART
worn I-ART
, O
looks O
elegantly O
out O
of O
place O
among O
the O
chaos O
. O
Papers B-ART
, I-ART
files I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
books I-ART
cover O
nearly O
every O
flat O
surface O
in O
the O
room O
. O


The O
walls B-ART
and O
floor O
are O
a O
clinical O
white B-ART
tile I-ART
and I-ART
marble I-ART
. O
However O
, O
the O
dim B-ART
lights I-ART
set I-ART
above O
this O
echoing O
space O
hiss O
and O
pop O
fitfully O
, O
giving O
the O
small O
maze O
of O
desks B-ART
and I-ART
workspaces I-ART
within O
a O
tarnished O
, O
decaying O
look O
. O


This O
walled B-ART
off O
area O
sits O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
massive O
staircase B-ART
which O
leads O
into O
the O
building O
to O
the O
north O
. O
At O
its O
base O
is O
a O
sign B-ART
reading O
Bethlehem B-ART
Hospital I-ART
Administration O
. O
The O
outer B-ART
walls I-ART
meet O
here O
meeting O
at O
the O
distant O
gates B-ART
which O
sit O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


This O
room O
is O
mostly O
empty O
space O
. O
The O
farthest O
wall B-ART
is O
lined O
with O
gleaming O
, O
brass B-ART
pull I-ART
file I-ART
drawers B-ART
and O
seems O
to O
go O
on O
infinitely O
in O
every O
direction O
. O
The O
entrance O
to O
the O
west O
opens O
onto O
a O
solid O
, O
dusty B-ART
platform B-ART
, O
which O
allows O
visitors O
to O
stand O
suspended O
above O
the O
unseen O
floor O
. O


The O
slight O
wind O
whistles O
tunelessly O
against O
this O
mesh B-ART
of I-ART
steel I-ART
, O
which O
arcs O
from O
one O
massive B-ART
, I-ART
opened I-ART
gate I-ART
to O
another O
. O
A O
roof B-ART
curves O
far O
overhead O
, O
enclosing O
both B-ART
the O
block O
like O
building O
to O
the O
east O
and O
the O
narrow B-ART
tower I-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O
Far O
below O
, O
an O
intricate O
set O
of O
sub O
buildings B-ART
can O
be O
seen O
, O
enclosed O
within O
the O
complex's O
outer B-ART
wall I-ART
. O


Snow O
is O
all O
around O
you O
, O
reducing O
everything B-ART
in O
sight O
to O
a O
vast O
, O
white B-ART
, O
featureless O
plain B-ART
. O
You'd O
hardly O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
one O
direction O
from O
another O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
sun B-ART
rapidly O
sinking B-ART
towards O
the O
western O
horizon B-ART
, O
and O
the O
mountains B-ART
up O
ahead O
to O
the O
north O
. O
Unless O
you're O
much O
mistaken O
, O
those O
mountains B-ART
mark O
the O
end O
of O
your O
quest O
, O
but O
you O
won't O
reach O
them O
tonight O
. O
Indeed O
, O
if O
you O
don't O
find O
shelter O
soon O
, O
you'll O
probably O
freeze O
. O


The O
track B-ART
is O
knee O
deep B-ART
in O
snow B-ART
. O
To O
the O
south O
the O
ground B-ART
descends O
gently O
back O
towards O
the O
plain O
, O
while O
to O
the O
north O
it O
meanders O
towards O
the O
distant B-ART
mountain I-ART
. O
Just O
to O
the O
west O
is O
the O
mouth B-ART
of O
a O
cave B-ART
where O
you O
could O
take O
shelter O
for O
the O
night O
. O
Some O
distance O
above O
the O
mouth B-ART
of O
the O
cave B-ART
a O
small B-ART
, I-ART
leafless I-ART
tree I-ART
clings O
to O
the O
barren B-ART
hillside I-ART
. O


The O
cave B-ART
is O
irregular O
in O
shape O
, O
as O
if O
scooped O
out B-ART
of O
the O
rock B-ART
by O
a O
mad O
giant O
in O
a O
fit O
of O
rage O
. O
The O
rear B-ART
of O
the O
cave B-ART
is O
broad O
, O
with O
a O
crooked B-ART
cranny I-ART
leading O
off O
to O
the O
northwest O
, O
but O
it's O
much O
narrower O
at O
the O
east O
end O
, O
just O
by O
the O
exit O
. O
The O
centre O
of O
the O
cave B-ART
is O
fairly O
spacious O
, O
and O
is O
at O
least O
dry O
and O
sheltered O
from O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
where O
the O
ground B-ART
isn't O
too O
rough O
. O


This O
small B-ART
nook I-ART
is O
formed O
by O
a O
short O
jagged O
passage O
running O
from O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
cave B-ART
, O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
where O
the O
nook B-ART
wall I-ART
closes O
in O
. O
There's O
quite O
a O
musty O
smell O
but O
barely B-ART
enough O
light O
to O
see O
by O
here O
, O
so O
to O
find O
anything O
you'd O
need O
to O
feel O
your O
way O
, O
but O
you O
can O
just O
see O
that O
the O
main O
part O
of O
the O
cave B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


A O
row O
of O
suites B-ART
runs O
north O
south O
between O
the O
tavern O
and O
the O
south O
wing O
. O
It's O
dilapidated O
and O
heavily O
boarded O
up O
, O
much O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
surroundings O
. O


This O
is O
the O
office O
of O
Dirk O

, O
the O
only O
detective O
agency O
which O

Your O
desk B-ART

file I-ART
cabinet I-ART
are O
here O
, O
but O
sitting O
on O
the O

fairly O
uncomfortable O

The O

nearby O

west O

and O
your O

far O

The O

almost O

that O
everyone O

It O
extends O

Your O

the O
crowded B-ART
portico B-ART
continues O
to O
the O
west O

More O
people B-ART
are O
relaxing O
here O
, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
the O
kegman B-ART
who O
sells O
his O
beer B-ART
under O
the O

This O

It's O
been O
just O
about O
half B-ART
a O
year O
since O
the O

of O

, O
but B-ART
even O
in O
that O
short B-ART
period O
, O
you've O
made O
many O
memories O
. O
Mornings O
are O
the O
most O
pleasant O
here O
, O
sunlight O
shines O
through O
the O
windows B-ART
, O
casting O
the O
room O
in O
the O
golden O
hue O
of O
the O

Your O

The O
walls B-ART

mostly O
white O

no O

anything O
, O
you O
prefer O
it O
neat O

Almost O
everything B-ART
is O
ordered O

not O
a O

is O
usually O
out B-ART

His O

That's O
what O
you O
liked O
about O
him B-ART

his O
realness O
. O
Always O
, O
when O
you O
were O
around O
him B-ART

you O
felt O

is O
what O
attracted O
you O
to O
him B-ART

Flashing O
, O
multihued O
lights O
and O
a O
throbbing O
sound O
system O
bring O
life O
to O
this O
otherwise O
barren O
establishment O
. O
A O
few O
people O
seem O
to O
be O
clustered O
around O
the O
bar O
to O
the O
east O

the O

it O
doesn't O

Unlike O
the O

this O

untouched O

The O

their O

The O
windows B-ART
to O
the O
west O
are O
smashed O
, O
but O
the O
curtains B-ART
are O
still O
hanging O
. O
It O
looks O
like O
the O
only O
thing O
that's O
been O
disturbed O
is O
the O
bed B-ART
, O
and O
we O
know O
who O
to O
blame O
for O
that O
. O


The O

dark O
hallway B-ART
continues O
from O
east O
to O
west O

The O
walls O
are O
adorned O
with O
flaming B-ART
torches I-ART
. O


You O
look O
around O
again O
. O
The O
carriage B-ART
is O
small O
and O
is O
practically O
empty O
. O
On O
the O
floor O
in O
front O
of O
you O
is O
a O
sea O
of O
dead B-ART
wasps I-ART
there's O
not O
a O
live O
one O
to O
be O
found O
. O
You O
look O
over O
at O
your O
only O
living O
companion B-ART
, O
tied O
up O
and O
leaning O
against O
the O
wall B-ART
opposite I-ART
you O
. O
Your O
eyes O
meet O
, O
and O
you O
try O
to O
convey O
sympathy O
, O
and O
you O
try O
to O
read O
sympathy O
from O
his O
, O
but O
that O
wouldn't O
do O
either O
of O
you O
any O
good O
even O
if O
you O
could O
hide O
the O
fear O
. O
The O
light B-ART
flickers I-ART
off O
for O
a O
second O
, O
sending O
you O
temporarily O
into O
darkness B-ART
. O


You're O
only O
aware O
of O
a O
mild O
tingling B-ART
in O
your O
fingertips B-ART
. O


Your O
throat O
feels O
dry O
and O
scratchy O
, O
and O
your O
feet O
feel O
like O
they're O
light B-ART
years O
away O
. O


The O
inside O
of O
Cryotube O
451 O
is O
still O
bitter O
cold O
, O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
decades O
of O
deep O
space O
travel O
and O
cryogenic B-ART
hibernation O
. O
Given O
the O
harsh O
temperatures O
required O
for O
cryosleep O
, O
the O
name O
of O
your O
particular O
tube O
seems O
a O
cruel O
irony O
. O
Still O
, O
it O
is O
entirely O
identical O
to O
the O
other O
four B-ART
hundred O
and O
nintey O
nine B-ART
chambers O
on O
this O

It's O
midnight O

There's O
blood O
everywhere O
because O
, O
hot O
diggety O
ding O
dong O
damn O
, O

the O

I O

weird O
, O
man O
. O
The O
corpse B-ART
of O
the O
man O
you O
most O
royally O
ensporked O
for O
trying O
to O
destroy O
the O
Universe O
with O
only O
his O
pinkie O
finger O
he O
can O
do O
that O
, O
you O
know O
is O
lying O
in O
front O
of O
you O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
derelict O
, O
teal O
, O
horrible O
smelling O
men's O
room O
. O
There's O
an O
entrance O
to O
the O
hallway O
of O
the O
abandoned O
community O
center O
that O
you're O
in O
to O
the O
South O
. O


A O
stark O
circular O
spotlight B-ART
high O
above O
you O
shines O
on O
a O
polished O
marble B-ART
floor O

The O
darkness B-ART
outside O
the O
spotlight B-ART
is O
total O
. O


Before O
you O
, O
to O
the O
north O
, O
stands O
Morkenmindan's O
Mediocre O
Manor B-ART
. O


First O
impressions O
are O
very O
important O
, O
so O
foyers O
are O
often O
the O
grandest O
rooms O
in O
a O
building B-ART
. O
If O
this O
is O
the O
most O
impressive O
room O
in O
the O
manor B-ART
, O
then O
you've O
got O
a O
long O
, O
long O
day O
ahead O
of O
you O
. O
Open O
archways O
stand O
to O
the O
north O
, O
west O
, O
and O
east O
. O


The O
kitchen O
is O
monumentally O
filthy O
. O
You O
look O
for O
some O
place B-ART
to O
start O
a O
grubby O
teacup O
to O
pour O
down O
the O
sink O
, O
perhaps O
but O
give O
up O
in O
despair O
. O
An O
archway O
to O
the O
south O
affords O
you O
an O
escape O
from O
the O
stench O
. O
There's O
also O
a O
door B-ART
to O
a O
pantry B-ART
or O
something O
, O
to O
the O
east O

This O
smallish O
room O
is O
filled O
by O
a O
staircase B-ART
which O
leads O
up O
to O
. O
. O
. O
well O
, O
nowhere O
, O
actually O
. O
Its O
only O
purpose O
is O
to O
entrap O
intruders O
, O
which O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
done O
with O
lethal O
efficiency O
. O
They O
must O
have O
entered O
from O
the O
east O
. O


You O
stand O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
grove B-ART
of I-ART
aspen I-ART
, O
which O
extends O
in O
all O
directions O
. O
Slender O
white B-ART
trunks I-ART
reach O
for O
the O
sky B-ART
with O
long O
thin O
fingers O
, O
stroking O
the O
clouds B-ART
that O
blow O
in O
the O
autumn O
breeze B-ART
. O
Leaves B-ART
of I-ART
gold I-ART
rattle O
as O
the O
winds B-ART
shift O
, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
one O
floats O
to O
the O
ground O
to O
join O
others O
that O
crackle O
underfoot O
when O
you O
move O
. O
A O
narrow O
path B-ART
disappears O
east O
into O
the O
trees B-ART
, O
and O
a O
camping O
area O
is O
visible O
through O
a O
small O
opening O
to O
the O

North O
is O
a O
wide O
meadow O

Remote O

secluded O
, O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot O
for O

The O
ground B-ART

flat O

slightly O
higher O
in O
the O
middle B-ART
of O
the O

A O
small O
two O

between O
a O

of O
the O

You O
can O
see O
a O
meadow B-ART

a O
path B-ART

A O
large B-ART
bull I-ART

sit O
in O
the O

of O
the O

The O
stream B-ART

treacherous O
further O
downstream O
to O
the O
west O
, O
the O
rapids B-ART
there O
splashing O
white B-ART
water I-ART
with O

The O

you O

your O

carefully O

Farther O

a O
granite B-ART

blocks O
your O

You O

of O
a O
slowly O
moving O
mountain O
stream B-ART

The O
water B-ART
is O
colder B-ART
than O
you O
had O
hoped O
, O
and O
is O
quickly O
numbing O
your O
bare O
feet O

ankles O
. O
Rocks B-ART

the O
bottom O
of O
the O

You O
are O
at O
the O

an O
enticing O
mountain O
stream B-ART

The O
sound O
of O
the O
water B-ART
flowing O
over O
rounded O
stones B-ART
is O
enough O
to O
bring O
relaxation O
to O
even O
the O
weariest O
of O
travelers O

Good O
thing O

too O
, O
as O
your O
sore O

over O

many O
rough O
roads O

Since O

since O
this O

it O

The O

The O
street B-ART

the O

had O
energy O

games O
of O

would O
be O
played O
in O
this O
garden O

You O
can O
almost O
hear O
the O
chirping O
as O
you O
would O
frantically O
hop O
from O
sculpture B-ART

A O

some O

Before O
the O
party O
people B-ART
invaded O
it O
, O
this O
was O
a O
spacious O
, O
cozy O
room O
. O
Now O
, O
you O
have O
to O
wade O
through O
thick O
smoke O
to O
escape O
either O
westwards O
to O
the O
hallway O
or O
to O
the O
Kitchen O
and O
the O
Pool O
beyond O
to O
the O

The O
main O
feature O
of O
this O

is O
the O
impressive O
glass O
door O
, O
which O
leads O
south O

to O
the O

All O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
are O
more O
people B-ART
here O
than O
in O
the O
living O
room O

Pauls O
Parents O
are O
rather O
fond O
of O
this O
small O
pool B-ART
. O
It's O
surrounded O
by O
some O
deck O
chairs O
. O
The O
eastern O
and O
western O
garden O
walls B-ART
are O
overgrown O
with O
undergrowth B-ART
, O
so O
as O
to O
hide O
the O
family O
members O
going O
for O
a O
seamelss O
tan O
. O
This O
wasn't O
necessary O
for O
the O
southern O
wall B-ART
, O
wich O
is O
quite O
high O
, O
because O
it O
borders O
on O
a O
Golf O
course O
Pauls O
told O
you O
they O
find O
the O
occasional O
golf O
ball O
in O
the O
pool B-ART
nonetheless O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
just O
outside B-ART
of O
your O
house B-ART

situated O
in O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
town O

Near O
the O
mailbox B-ART
crudely O
attached O
to O
an O
iron B-ART
pole I-ART
the O
path B-ART
splits O
into O
two B-ART
one O
runs O
to O
the O
north O

the O

to O
the O
east O

where O
your O

You're O
standing O
outside B-ART

your O
garage B-ART

a O
small O

The O
path O
runs O
back O
to O
the O
west O
, O
and O
the O
driveway O
leads O
north O
. O


When O
you O
opened B-ART
your O
eyes O
you O
weren't O
surprised O
at O
all O
to O
find O
yourself B-ART
in O
a O
small O
featureless O
cell O
with B-ART
no O
obvious O
exits B-ART
. O
But O
there O
must O
be O
a O
way O
to O
get O
out B-ART
somehow O
. O
At O
least O
you O
aren't O
going O
to O
sit O
there O
and O
wait O
until O
THEY O
come O
. O
. O
. O


A O
small B-ART
room I-ART
without O
any O
exits O
. O
You O
are O
here O
, O
staring O
at O
the O
gray B-ART
walls I-ART
. O
The O
only O
furniture O
is O
a O
big B-ART
round I-ART
table I-ART
but O
no O
chair O
, O
and O
a O
small B-ART
cabinet I-ART
in O
the O
corner O
. O


You O
are O
in O
the O
cramped O
, O
sticky O
, O
smelly O
, O
and O
oppressively O
humid O
pilot's O
compartment O
of O
your O
borrowed O
spaceship B-ART
. O
The O
walls B-ART
, O
floor O
, O
and O

of O
the O

are O
made O
of O
rubbery B-ART
gray I-ART
tubelike I-ART
structures I-ART
, O
interrupted O
only O
by O
the O
airlock B-ART
door B-ART
to O
your O
east O
. O
There O
is O
a O
seat B-ART
, O
of O
sorts O
, O
but O
it's O
broad O
, O
low O
, O
awkward O
, O
and O
even O
more O
suspiciously O
damp O
than O
the O
rest O
of O
the O

Far O
off O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
is O
a O
huge O
, O
dark O
, O
mansion O
sitting O
on O
a O
flat O
lawn O
, O
where O
a O
man O
lives O
, O
your O
newly O
discovered O
thief O
. O
You O
are O
north O
of O
this O
house O
, O
and O
you O
notice O
that O
it O
has O
millions O
of O
small O
, O
circular O
windows O
staring O
out B-ART
, O
but O
strangely O
all O
of O
the O
curtains O
are O
closed O
. O
There O
is O
a O
slightly O
foreboding O
air O
to O
the O
house O
, O
and O
a O
dark O
path O
continues O
to O
the O
northeast O
and O
another O
to O
the O
northwest O
, O
where O
barking O
can O
be O
heard O
. O


You O
round O
the O
northeast O
corner O
, O
away O
from O
the O
barking O
noise O
, O
and O
discover O
some O
large O
, O
sturdy O
vines B-ART
, O
which O
appear O
climbable O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
rooftop O
. O


Like O
every O
dog B-ART
lover O
, O
you O
investigate O
the O
barking O
, O
wondering O
what's O
the O
ruckus O
? O
You're O
not O
certain O
of O
the O
breed O
so O
you O
take O
a O
closer O
look O
. O


You O
scramble O
up O
the O
strong O
vines B-ART
, O
pulling O
yourself O
up O
onto O
the O
rooftop O
. O
The O
roof O
is O
huge O
. O
Moonlight O
reflecting O
from O
the O
attic's O
skylight B-ART
draws O
your O
attention O
. O
Take O
great O
care O
on O
this O
slippery O
, O
slate O
roof O
. O


You O
land O
lightly O
on O
an O
old O
wooden O
floor O
, O
a O
millennia's O
worth O
of O
dust O
softening O
your O
fall O
as O
you O
observe O
your O
surroundings O
. O
You O
have O
landed O
in O
the O
attic O
, O
surrounded O
solely O
by O
spiders O
and O
their O
webs O
. O
The O
thick O
spider O
webs O
are O
huge O
, O
their O
spiraling O
strands O
of O
thread O
flowing O
out B-ART
like O
weightless O
bands O
with O
minds O
of O
their O
own O
. O
As O
your O
eyes O
adjust O
to O
the O
gloom O
that O
not O
even O
your O
flashlight O
can O
penetrate O
, O
you O
also O
notice O
a O
large O
wooden O
box B-ART
with O
a O
loose O
top O
over O
it O
. O
There O
is O
a O
heavy O
, O
old O
carpet O
with O
a O
slightly O
raised O
edge O
, O
covered O
in O
dust O
. O


Dropping O
gently O
down O
from O
the O
attic's O
ladder O
, O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
master O
bedroom B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
grand O
brick O
fireplace B-ART
, O
powered O
by O
a O
small O

, O
which O
is O
turned O

Upon O
the O
sparse O
covers O
of O
the O
king O
size O
bed B-ART
, O
the O
twisted O
, O
strange O
thief O
lies O
, O
fast O
asleep O
, O
and O
there O
appears O
to O
be O
something O
sticking O
out B-ART
from O
under O
the O
bed B-ART
. O
Something O
else O
of O
interest O
is O
to O
the O
west O
. O
There O
is O
not O
a O
hallway O
out B-ART
the O
door O
, O
just O
a O
creaky O
, O
wooden O
staircase O
that O
is O
no O

You O
walk O
quickly O
on O
an O
unstable O
wooden B-ART
floor O
, O
with O
floorboards O
bending O
ominously O
under O
your O
weight O
, O
creaking O

You O
arrive O
in O
the O

is O
very O
elegant O

with O
a O
long O
carpet O
underfoot O

, O
because O
you O
bought O
a O
special O
magic O
house O
where O
toast B-ART
can't O
get O
wet O
! O
You O
Are O
Smart O
! O


It O
is O
early O
, O
and O
the O
grass B-ART
is O
wet O
. O
The O
woods B-ART
are O
thin O
enough O
that O
you O
can O
see O
the O
low O
, O
yellow O
sun B-ART
through O
the O
trees B-ART
. O
Thin O
trails O
of O
smoke B-ART
curl O
up O
into O
the O
sky B-ART
above O
. O


These O
are O
the O
hunting O
woods B-ART
of O
the O
people O
. O
The O
ground B-ART
is O
tangled O
and O
leafy O
. O
You O
do O
not O
know O
the O
woods B-ART
as O
well O
as O
Nok O
or O
Gal O
, O
but O
you O
know O
that O
the O
camp O
is O
back O
to O
the O
west O
. O


You O
wade O
through O
the O
pale O
swaying O
leaves B-ART
that O
curl O
up O
from O
the O
ground B-ART
. O
Twigs B-ART
break O
under O
your O
feet O
. O
A O
rough O
path O
leads O
east O
and O
south O
from O
here O
. O


The O
trees B-ART
are O
thick O
and O
dark O
here O
. O
Low O
bushes B-ART
grow O
between O
them O
, O
and O
you O
recognise O
the O
berries B-ART
that O
Gal O
used O
to O
bring O
. O


You O
stand O
in O
a O
gap O
where O
there O
are O
no O
trees B-ART
. O
The O
leafy O
plants O
have O
been O
cropped O
low O
, O
and O
a O
round O
pit B-ART
has O
been O
dug O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
clearing O
. O


The O
hole O
of O
dirt B-ART
and I-ART
rock I-ART
is O
deeper O
than O
you O
are O
tall O
. O
Your O
feet O
stand O
in O
wet O
mud B-ART
. O
Sticks B-ART
and I-ART
broken I-ART
branches I-ART
are O
strewn O
about O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
dead B-ART
and O
bloodied O
stag B-ART
slumped O
against O
the O
dirt B-ART
wall O
. O


Under O
overhanging O
boughs B-ART
the O
road B-ART
runs O
southward O
towards O
Rhederfeld O
. O
Off O
in O
the O
shadow B-ART
of O
the O
trees B-ART
, O
the O
outer B-ART
wall O
of O
the O

shrine I-ART
is O
pierced O
by O
a O
narrow B-ART

narrower I-ART
arrow O

. O
The O
chapel B-ART
dome I-ART
rears O
up O
just O
over O
the O
wall O
, O
offering O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
shelter O
within O
. O
Without O
, O
the O
trees B-ART
scratch O
against O
the O
stone B-ART

the O

Solid O
stone O

your O

The O
air O
is O
cool O
and O
the O
tunnel B-ART

dark O
, O
lit O
only O
by O

filtering O

the O

Its O

A O
short O
, O
plain O
hall O
, O
almost O
a O
repeat O
of O
the O
tunnel O
in O
the O
outer B-ART
wall O
through O
which O
you O
entered O
. O
This O
one O
is O
truly O
out O
of O
the O
elements O
, O
however O
, O
and O
the O
sounds O
of O
the O
storm O
outside O
are O
muffled O
. O
The O
coldness O
of O
the O
stone O
walls O
is O
softened O
by O
a O
layer O
of O
deep B-ART
blue I-ART
carpet I-ART
and O
a O
pair B-ART
of I-ART
torches I-ART
, O
burning O

In O

to O
the O

there O

The O

In O
front O
of O
you O
, O
across O
a O
narrow O
strip O
of O
grass O
, O
sits O
the O
shrine B-ART
itself O
. O
Although O
most O
of O
the O
temple B-ART
is O
two O
stories O
high O
, O
an O
enclosure O
around O
the O
main O
door B-ART
thrusts O
forward O
to O
meet O
the O
outer O

which O
stands O
open O
in O
the O

behind O
you O
. O
The O
walls O
sweep O
back O
to O
either O
side O
of O
the O

meeting O
the O
higher O
dome B-ART
of O
the O
inner O

leaving O
large O
grassy B-ART
courts I-ART
to O
your O

The O

doors I-ART
are O
set B-ART
back O
beneath O
an O
overhanging O
roof B-ART
, O
forming O
a O
shallow O

The O

a O

the O

of O
a O

of I-ART
braziers I-ART
at O
the O

The O
firelight B-ART
seems O
to O

The O

the O

A O
narrow B-ART
lane I-ART
leads O
off O
across O
the O
fields B-ART
to O
the O
east O

The O
path B-ART
from O
the O

starts O
to O
climb O
the O
ridge B-ART
where O
you O
expect O
to O
find O
your O

Worryingly B-ART

there's O
no O

no O

More B-ART
worryingly B-ART

you O
hear O

no O

no O

The O
narrow B-ART
lane I-ART
from O

comes O
to O
an O
end O
outside B-ART
a O
solitary B-ART
hut I-ART
in O
the O

of O
the O

The O
top B-ART
of O
the O
ridge B-ART
which O
continues O
to O
east O
and O
west O
affords O
a O
depressingly O
good O
view B-ART
over O
the O
valley B-ART
below I-ART
depressing O
because O
the O
size O
of O
the O
enemy B-ART
camp I-ART
is O
all O
too O
apparent O
. O
A O
path B-ART
leads O
back O
down O
the O
ridge B-ART
to O
the O
south O
, O
while O
piles B-ART
of I-ART
abandoned I-ART
equipment I-ART
lie O
all O
around O
. O


There's O
still O
an O
excellent O
view B-ART
over O
the O
valley B-ART
from O
here O
, O
although O
the O
main O
part O
of O
the O
ridge B-ART
lies O
to O
the O
west O
. O
Further O
to O
the O
east O
the O
land B-ART
slopes O
down O
into O
a O
wood B-ART
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
steep B-ART
path I-ART
round O
the O
wood B-ART
to O
the O
northeast B-ART
. O
Several O
tents B-ART
have O
been O
left O
abandoned B-ART
, O
half O
dismantled B-ART
by O
fleeing O
deserters O
; O
the O
only O
one O
left O
standing O
looks O
like O
a O
supply B-ART
tent I-ART
immediately O
to O
the O
south O
. O


Although O
the O
valley B-ART
below I-ART
looks O
full B-ART
of I-ART
enemy I-ART
tent I-ART
s O
, O
up O
here O
on O
the O
west O
end B-ART
of O
the O
ridge B-ART
there's O
only O
one O
, O
just O
to O
the O
south O
of O
where O
you O
stand O
, O
a O
large B-ART
canvas I-ART
structure I-ART
that O
would O
almost O
certainly O
be O
the O
command B-ART
tent I-ART
were O
there O
still O
an O

here O
to O

The O
remainder O
of O
the O
ridge B-ART
slopes O
away O
to O
the O
west O
, O
but O
the O
bulk O
of O
it O
lies O
to O
the O
east O
. O


It O
looks O
surprisingly O
bare O
, O
for B-ART
a O
command B-ART
tent I-ART
; O
perhaps O
the O
deserting O
troops O
looted O
it O
before O

A O
plain B-ART

still O
stands O
near O
the O

while O
a O
metal B-ART
strong O

A O
small O

The O

This O

the O

The O

The O

The O

a O
dark O

the O
Broken O

A O
fat B-ART

noisome I-ART

above B-ART
him I-ART

casting O
a O

across O
the O

The O
inn O
was O
quiet O
. O
Thick B-ART
, I-ART
oak I-ART
beams I-ART
arched O
low O
overhead O
and O
the O
thin O
layer O
of O
what O
might O
once O

straw B-ART
underfoot O
suggested O
that O
it O
might O
hide O
more O

just O
the O

it O
. O
An O
open B-ART
doorway I-ART
was O
set O
in O
the O
Widdershins B-ART
wall O
, O
beside O
a O
flight B-ART
of I-ART
worn I-ART
steps I-ART
which O
led O
up O
to O
a O
dingy O
courtyard O
. O
The O
bar B-ART
was O
arranged O
, O
albeit O
rather O
untidily O
, O
against O
the O
Rimward B-ART
wall O
. O


Rincewind O
stood O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
cellar B-ART
steps I-ART

A O
rusty B-ART
, I-ART
iron I-ART
handrail I-ART
hung O
limply O
off O
the O
cracked B-ART
stone I-ART
wall I-ART
, O
leading O
precipitously O
down O
into O
the O
gloom O
below B-ART

The O
cellar O
was O
, O
like O
the O
tavern O
above B-ART
, O
low O
ceilinged B-ART
. O
Various B-ART
crates I-ART

barrels I-ART
were O
stacked B-ART
round O
the O

a O
heavy O
wooden O

set O
in O
the O
roof O
against O
the O
Widdershins B-ART

Some O
steps O
led O
upstairs O

The O
back B-ART
street I-ART
was O
dimly O
lit O
by O
the O
odd B-ART
sparking I-ART
torch I-ART
. O
Apart O
from O
a O
small O
trapdoor B-ART
in O
the O
ground B-ART
at O
the O
back B-ART
of O
The O
Broken B-ART
Drum I-ART
, O
the O
street B-ART
was O
completely O
uninviting O
, O
a O
long O
stretch O
of O
stone B-ART
and I-ART
wood I-ART
walls I-ART
, O
extending O
Hubward B-ART

Rimward I-ART

Rincewind B-ART

balanced O
precariously O
on O
the O
window B-ART

outside B-ART
Twoflower's I-ART
room O

It O
was O

decided O

a O
very O
long O
way O
down O

The O
pestilent O
vista B-ART
of I-ART
Morpork I-ART
extended O
some O
way O
to O
the O
river B-ART
, O
its O
aromatic O
haze O
obscuring O
the O
view O
of O
twilit O
Ankh B-ART
on O
the O
far O
bank O
. O
The O
view O
of O
the O
street B-ART
below I-ART
was O
, O
however O
, O
much O
more O
breathtaking O
. O
A O
drainpipe B-ART
clung O
to O
the O
wall O
, O
almost O
as O
tightly O
as O
Rincewind B-ART
. O
But O
not O
quite O
. O


The O
room O
was O
small B-ART
and O
shabby O
but O
, O
to O
a O
tourist O
, O
quaint O
. O
Rincewind B-ART
thought O
it O
hateful O
. O
A O
small B-ART
, O
hard O
bed B-ART
occupied O
one O
corner O
. O
The O
walls B-ART
were O
bare B-ART
, O
save O
for O
a O
door B-ART
Turnwise I-ART
, O
a O
window B-ART
and O
the O
odd B-ART
trickle I-ART
of I-ART
water I-ART
. O


A O
small B-ART
hallway O
, O
brightly O
lit O
by O
a O
row O
of O
neon O

Dark O
wooden O
stairs O
lead O
upwards O

and O
a O
doorframe B-ART
opens O
west O
into O
the O
Living O

Your O
steps O
don't O
make O
any O
sound O
on O
the O
the O
thick B-ART

red O
carpet B-ART
. O


Before O
the O
party O
people B-ART
invaded O
it O
, O
this O
was O
a O
spacious O
, O
cozy O
room O
, O
which O
one O
of O
those O
big O

expensive O
TV's O

Now O
, O
you O
have O
to O
wade O
through O
thick O
smoke O
to O
escape O
either O
eastwards O
to O
the O

or O
to O
the O
Kitchen O

Once O

there O

Soon O

Paul's O
Parents O
were O
rather O
fond O
of O
this O
small O
pool B-ART
. O
In O
their O
time O
, O
it O
wasn't O
filled O
with O
bubbling O
green O
acid B-ART
, O
though O
. O
It O
is O
surrounded O
by O
some O
deck B-ART
chair I-ART
made O
of O
bones B-ART
. O
The O
eastern O
and O
western O
garden O
walls B-ART
are O
overgrown O
with O
undergrowth B-ART
, O
made O
of O
screaming B-ART
faces I-ART
, O
which O
is O
quite O
distracting O
. O
A O
glass B-ART
door I-ART
leads O
north O
to O
the O
kitchen O
. O
This O
wasn't O
necessary O
for O
the O
southern B-ART
southern I-ART
wall I-ART
, O
which O
is O
quite O
high O
, O
because O
it O
borders O
on O
a O
Golf O
course O
Well O
, O
it O
did O
on O
Earth O
. O
Who O
knows O
what O
horrors O
await O
you O
beyond O
? O
Well O

Wally B-ART

You O
are O
on O
top O
of O
one O
of O
the O
innumberable O
hills O
of O
the O
golf B-ART
course O
. O
You O
can O
see O
the O
whole O
golf B-ART
course O
around O
you O
, O
which O
is O
boring O
as O
hell O
. O
The O
only O
interesting O
thing O
is O
a O
shimmering O
and O
whispering O
portal B-ART
, O
to O
the O
east O

The O
room O
is O
small O
, O
dark O
, O
and O
smells O
faintly O
of O
rawhide B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
domed O
exit O
to O
the O
north O
, O
through O
which O
you O
can O
smell O
autumn O
leaves B-ART
. O
A O
mastiff B-ART
sleeps O
gently O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
something O
white O
barely O
visible O
behind O
his O
heavy O
curled O
hide O
. O


Squinting O
into O
the O
sunlight B-ART
, O
you O
are O
engulfed O
in O
a O
wildfire O
of O
crisping O
, O
swirling O
red O
and O
yellow O
leaves B-ART
. O
They O
swirl O
ferociously O
around O
, O
making O
you O
dizzy O
. O
You O
need O
to O
get O
out B-ART
of O
here O
quickly O
. O
A O
faded O
red O
doghouse O
peels O
in O
the O
strong O
sun O
to O
the O
south O
. O


You O
are O
inside O
of O
your O
head B-ART
, O
trembling O
on O
the O
convolutions O
of O
that O
pink O
sponge O
of O
yours O
. O
I O
think O
this O
tends B-ART
to O
mean O
that O
in O
a O
certain O
way O
, O
you've O
lost O
control O
with O
reality O
. O
Above O
you O
bends O
the O
dome B-ART
of O
your O
skull B-ART
, O
with O
walls B-ART
enameled O
with O
gelatine O
; O
in O
front O
of O
you O
, O
two B-ART
odd O
sized O
spheres O
slowly O
swivel O
around O
their O
axis O
you O
realize O
that O
you O
can O
slow O
the O
process O
down O
, O
which O
might O
show O
that O
you O
still O
own O
a O
bit O
of O
your O
physical O
means O
. O
On O
the O
left O
flank O
of O
you O
body O
, O
your O
hands O
feel O
a O
precious O
leather O
bag B-ART
; O
that's O
the O
metrosexual O
bag B-ART
your O
mother O
offered O
for O
your O
35th O
birthday O
. O
I O
think O
something O
is O
wrong O
, O
without O
mentioning O
your O
current O
situation O
. O


The O
room O
appears O
completely O
white O
the O
ceiling B-ART
is O
white O
, O
the O
walls B-ART
are O
white O
, O
the O
floor O
is O
white O
and O
there O
is O
no O
discernable O
join O
between O
the O
walls B-ART
and O
the O
floor O
. O


The O
room O
is O
small O
, O
musky O
, O
and O
windowless O
. O
A O
single O
light B-ART
bulb I-ART
is O
hanging O
overhead O
, O
controlled O
by O
a O
light B-ART
switch I-ART
. O
A O
bed B-ART
is O
pushed O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
leaving O
only O
a O
little O
room O
for O
standing O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
made O
of O
solid O
gray O
concrete O
and O
are O
colored O
by O
various O
stains O
you'd O
rather O
not O
speak O
of O
. O
There O
is O
one O
hole B-ART
in O
the O
wall O
for O
electricity O
. O
A O
wooden B-ART
door I-ART
separates O
this O
room O
from O
the O
hallway O
to O
the O
north O
. O


There O
is O
a O
strange O
smell O
of O
garlic O
that O
infects O
everything B-ART
, O
including O
yourself B-ART
, O
growing O
stronger O
every O
second O
. O


Behind O
you O
is O
the O
entrance O
that O
you O
worked O
so O
hard O
to O
find O
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
a O
craggy O
passageway O
leads O
into O
the O
distance O
, O
spotted O
with O
small O
pools B-ART
of I-ART
lava I-ART
and I-ART
cracks I-ART
. O


The O
walls B-ART
here O
are O
made O
of O
stone O
, O
covered O
in O
runes B-ART
. O
Most O
of O
them O
are O
meaningless O
to O
you O
, O
except O
for O
an O
inscription B-ART
above O
the O
gate B-ART
to O
the O
north O
. O


As O
far O
as O
kitchens O
go O
, O
this O
is O
certainly O
a O
kitchen O
. O
There O
is O
a O
table B-ART
sitting O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it O
, O
surrounded O
by O
chairs B-ART
. O
A O
bench B-ART
with O
a O
sink B-ART
installed O
sits O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
room O
, O
with O
a O
window B-ART
above O
it O
letting O
light O
into O
the O
room O
. O


Your O
cluttered O
, O
occassionally O
filthy O
bedroom B-ART
. O
To O
the O
south O
is O
the O
kitchen O
. O


Small O
and O
bright O
, O
day O
or O
night O
. O
The O
living O
room O
is O
where O
movies O
are O
watched O
, O
video B-ART
games I-ART
are O
played O
, O
and O
life O
is O
lived O
. O


This O
vestibule O
connects O
the O
exterior O
of O
the O
pyramid O
to O
the O
burial O
complex O
inside O
. O
Air O
currents O
carry O
in O
a O
faint O
smell O
of O
the O
outdoors B-ART
. O


This O
room O
is O
given O
over O
to O
a O
large O
statue B-ART
of O
this O
tomb's O
tenant O
, O
the O
pharaoh B-ART
magician O
Apepsikret O
. O


Based O
on O
your O
knowledge O
of O
ancient O
Egyptian O
tombs O
, O
you O
are O
led O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
room O
originally O
contained O
the O
canopic O
jars B-ART
that O
housed O
Apepsikret's O
internal O
organs O
? O
but O
judging O
from O
the O
rubble B-ART
on O
the O
floor O
, O
the O
jars B-ART
and O
their O
contents O
are O
long O
gone O
. O


This O
room O
is O
dominated O
by O
a O
statue B-ART
of O
Apepsikret's O
mysterious O
consort O
. O


This O
room O
is O
unremarkable O
but O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
large B-ART
wooden I-ART
wheel I-ART
mounted O
in O
one O
wall O
. O


You O
are O
stranded O
in O
a O
sea B-ART
of O
chaos O
. O
Amidst O
swirling O
colours B-ART
that O
now O
and O
again O
form O
themselves O
into O
geometrical O
shapes B-ART
and O
arcane O
symbols B-ART
, O
you O
can O
make O
out B-ART
some O
things B-ART
floating O
around O
, O
unhindered O
by O
gravity O
or O
any O
other O
force O
. O


Your O
bedroom B-ART
is O
small O
and O
cozy O
. O
The O
walls O
and O
ceiling O
are O
paneled O
wood O
, O
lending O
the O
room O
a O
certain O
rustic O
charm O
. O
A O
door O
to O
the O
South O
leads O
to O
a O
darkened O
hallway O
. O


You O
can O
see O
a O
toilet B-ART
on O
which O
is O
a O
handwritten B-ART
note B-ART
, O
a O
shower B-ART
, O
a O
sink B-ART
and O
a O
mirror B-ART
here O
. O


Many O
rainy O
nights O
have O
been O
wiled O
away O
here O
watching O
moivies O
or O
playing O
games O
. O
North O
is O
the O
dining O
room O

To O
the O
west O
is O
the O

Though O
small O
, O
this O
room B-ART
has O
played O
host O
to O
many O
great O
feasts O
. O


Rather O
bland O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
of O
interest O
here O
is O
the O
armoire B-ART
. O


The O
provincial O
kitchen B-ART
is O
stocked O
with O
all O
the O
modern O
amenities O
. O
It O
smells O
of O
exotic O
spices O
and O
fresh O
brewed O
coffee B-ART
. O


There O
is O
a O
kitchen O
to O
the O
east O
, O
your O
bedroom O
to O
the O

, O
the O
cloakroom O
is O
west O

the O

And O
I O
almost O
forgot O
the O
front O
door B-ART
is O
to O
the O
northwest O
and O
the O

is O
northeast O

You O

a O

That's O
where O
you O

The O
lack O

the O
sparsity O

match O
the O
morbid O
nature O
of O
this O
room O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
white O

bare O

There O
is O
only O
one O

The O

of O
anyone O

be O
on O
the O

The O

You O

your O

On O

the O
patch B-ART
of I-ART
light I-ART
streaming O
into O
the O
cave B-ART
from O
the O

The O

and O
no O

The O
rough B-ART
cave I-ART
walls I-ART
widen O
northwards O
toward O
the O

and O
a O
faint B-ART
wailing I-ART
can O
be O

from O

It O

The O
hidden B-ART
valley I-ART

in O
all O
its O
glory O
before O
him B-ART

a O
small O

You O
see O
the O
big O

door B-ART
leading O
out B-ART
of O
the O

to O
the O

. O
It's O

a O

the O
Unix O

You O
can O
go O

There's O
a O

here O
and O
a O
fridge B-ART
too O
. O
And O
a O
coffeemaker B-ART
. O
But O
no O
toaster B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
least O
talky O
of O
the O
areas O
, O
but O
only O
because O
of O
the O
foozball B-ART
game O
eruptions O
disturb O
that O
. O
IT's O
cubicles B-ART
they O
get O
called O
off O

east O
, O
and O
the O
corridor O
goes O
south O
and O
also O
hooks O
around O
a O
bit O
north O
. O


You O
like O
this O
row O
. O
IT O
works O
here O
and O
they O
need O
more O
space O
. O
They're O
off O
site O
today O
, O
but O
fewer O
cubicles B-ART
mean O
less O
talking O
. O
It O
would O
be O
perfect O
if O
the O
foozball O
room O
weren't O
to O
the O
west O
with O
no O
other O
real O
way O
to O
go O

You O
can O
go O
back O

to O
the O
cubicles B-ART
you O
already O
passed O
. O
There O
are O
managers' O
offices O
to O
the O

You O
probably O
don't O
want O
to O

now O
. O


There's O
a O
chessboard B-ART
here O
. O
There's O
also O
a O
stack B-ART
of I-ART
papers I-ART
of O
old O

If O
this O
room O
was O
once O
intended O

, O
it O
now O
fails O
. O
A O
darkened O
staircase B-ART
leads O
upstairs O
. O
To O
the O
north O
, O
an O
Turkish O
arras B-ART
with O

hangs O
in O
an O
alcove O
. O
The O
west O
lies O
a O
set O
of O
French O
double B-ART
doors I-ART
. O


From O
the O
king O
size O
bed B-ART
and O
large O
windows O
, O
you O
gather O
that O
this O
is O
the O
master O
bedroom B-ART
. O


The O
butcher O
block O
counters O
are O
dark O
with O
grime O
. O
The O
cabinets O
have O
no O
doors B-ART
. O
There O
is O
no O
appliance O
here O
more O
modern O
than O
an O
ice O

. O
The O
unlit O
stairway O
leds O
upstairs O
. O
There O
are O
doorways B-ART
on O
the O
east O

south O
walls O
. O


Even O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
after O
the O

, O
this O
room O
is O
still O
chilly O
, O
if O

Between O
the O

the O
thawing O
bricks B-ART
of I-ART
soup I-ART
and I-ART
chili I-ART
and O
nacho O
cheez B-ART
, O
the O
freezer B-ART
wouldn't O
be O
a O
great O
place O
to O
try O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
But O
the O
walls B-ART
and I-ART
door I-ART
are O
thick O
, O
and O
impenetrable O
. O
As O
long O
as O
the O
zombies B-ART
don't O
pull O
on O
the O
handle B-ART
of O
the O
door B-ART
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
circular O
limestone B-ART

dance O
on O
every O
surface O

Winding O
around O

climbing O

dizzy O
, O
you're O
unsure O
how O
much O
you're O
swaying O

how O
much O
the O

At O
the O

you O

. O
On O
the O
table B-ART
you O
see O
a O
parchment B-ART
and O
a O
mug B-ART
. O


You O
are O
standing O
at O
the O
side O
of O
a O
busy O
road B-ART
, I-ART
Logic I-ART
Avenue I-ART
, O
to O
the O
west O
. O
An O
endless O
procession O
of O
cars B-ART
prevents O
you O
from O
crossing O
. O


You're O
in O
a O
section O
of O
dense O
pine B-ART
forest O
at O
the O
base O
of O
a O
small O
mountain O
. O
There O
are O
cones B-ART
and O
needles O
littered O
about O
, O
and O
the O
treetops B-ART
chatter O
with O
birdsong O
. O
The O
slope O
continues O
up O
the O
mountain O
, O
or O
back O
down O
towards O
the O
road O
. O


This O
is O
a O
wide O
field O
of O
untamed O
prairie O
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
a O
mountain O
rises O
up O
towards O
its O
summit O
, O
while O
another O
hill O
is O
faintly O
visible O
to O
the O
west O
. O
You O
also O
can O
make O
out B-ART
a O
faint O
trail O
leading O
northeast O
through O
the O
brush O
. O


Here O
at O
the O
top O
the O
mountain O
, O
the O
wind O
blows O
strong O
and O
carries O
the O
smell O
of O
endless O
summer O
. O
There O
are O
no O
trees O
up O
here O
, O
no O
tall O
grass O
, O
but O
bits O
of O
shrubbery B-ART
dot O
the O
area O
. O
The O
view O
is O
remarkable O
, O
though O
; O
you O
can O
see O
grassy O
hills O
for O
miles O
around O
. O
A O
train O
track O
clearly O
extends O
north O
into O
the O
distance O
, O
running O
away O
from O
this O
mountain O
. O


You're O
standing O
on O
a O
wide O
bluff O
about O
fifty O
feet O
up O
a O
small O
mountain O
, O
overlooking O
a O
landscape O
of O
sun O
blasted O
plains O
and O
craggy O
hills O
. O
Below O
you O
, O
a O
train O
track B-ART
runs O
out B-ART
of O
a O
narrow O
tunnel B-ART
though O
the O
hill O
. O
On O
the O
far O
edge O
of O
the O
bluff O
you O
see O
a O
strange O
rock O
formation B-ART
, O
and O
a O
path O
wanders O
southwest O
through O
the O
brush O
. O


The O
edge O
of O
the O
plateau O
stops O
abruptly O
at O
a O
chasm O
that O
drops O
nearly O
one O
hundred O
feet O
. O
Luckily O
, O
there's O
a O
flimsy B-ART
looking O
rope O
bridge B-ART
that O
spans O
the O
gap O
. O
It O
stretches O
westward O
to O
another O
isolated O
bluff O
. O
To O
the O
east O
, O
the O
grasses O
look O
more O
inviting O
. O


The O
staff's O
jubilant O
anticipation O
of O
the O
first O
human O
transfer B-ART
was O
now O
replaced O
with O
dread O
. O
Why O
had O
the O
Professor B-ART
fallen O
ill O
so O
suddenly O
? O
And O
how O
callous O
of O
the O
Overseers B-ART

After O
spending O
a O
whole O
day O
in O
the O
rain O
by O
Hadrian's O
Wall O
, O
a O
tour O
of O
McCain O
castle O
seemed O
like O
a O
drier O
way O
to O
pass O
the O
time O
. O
While O
listening O
half O
heartedly O
to O
the O
tour O
guide's O
monologue O
on O
the O
various O
paintings B-ART
in O
the O
room O
, O
you O
stop O
to O
get O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
a O
particularly O
striking O
painting B-ART
of O
a O
young O
girl O
with O
a O
cocker O
spaniel O
. O
A O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
you O
realize O
the O
group O
had O
moved O
on O
and O
left O
you O
behind O
. O
You O
are O
not O
sure O
how O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
them O
, O
nor O
how O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
foyer O
where O
the O
tours O
began O
and O
ended O
. O


You O
are O
in O
what O
was O
obviously O
a O
library O
when O
this O
castle O
had O
been O
in O
use O
. O
Rows O
and O
rows O
of O
floor O
to O
ceiling B-ART
bookshelves I-ART
line O
the O
walls B-ART
. O
If O
you O
were O
any O
younger O
or O
dressed O
properly O
, O
you O
would O
have O
tried O
to O
climb O
them O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
dusty O
, O
with O
multiple O
footprints B-ART
indicating O
the O
tour O
continued O
north O
. O
The O
door B-ART
to O
the O
north O
has O
inscriptions B-ART
carved O
across O
the O

. O
The O

entered O
by O
is O

the O
north O
, O
lit O
by O
flickering O
torches O
placed O
at O
decent O
intervals O
. O
Carvings B-ART
of O
people O
catch O
your O
eye O
on O
the O
wall B-ART
. O
You O
notice O
a O
curtain B-ART
to O
your O
east O
, O
where O
there O
should O
be O
no O
windows O
. O
There O
are O
some O
more O
inscriptions B-ART
on O
the O
floor O
. O


You O
are O
not O
quite O
sure O
what O
this O
room O
was O
used O
for O
. O
From O
the O
guidebook O
you O
read O
in O
the O
hotel O
, O
you O
are O
sure O
the O
McCains O
to O
whom O
this O
castle O
belongs O
to O
owned O
a O
lot O
of O
property O
. O
Seeing O
a O
large O
desk B-ART
, O
you O
decide O
this O
must O
have O
been O
the O
estate B-ART
manager's I-ART
office O
, O
where O
account O
ledgers O
were O
kept O
and O
decisions O
about O
what O
kind O
of O
sheep O
to O
raise O
, O
which O
distiller O
to O
use O
, O
and O
what O
crops O
to O
sell O
were O
made O

Tall O
windows O
allow O
for O
some O
light O
to O
enter O
the O

your O
south O

A O
light O
airy O
room O
, O
the O
conservatory O
is O
a O
marked O
contrast O
to O
the O
other O
musty O
dreary O
rooms O
you O
had O
seen O
thus O
far O
in O
the O
castle O
. O
Vines O
grow O
in O
profusion O
about O
the O
pillars O
and O
varieties O
of O
flowers O
bloom O
in O

There O
are O
several O

grouped O
in O
a O

near O
the O

Handy O
small O
tables B-ART
where O
one O
could O
place O
a O
teacup O

while O
conversing O
with O
guests O
are O
strategically O
placed O
by O
each B-ART
of O
the O
pillars O

Windows B-ART
are O
plentiful O

giving O
you O
a O
better O
view O
of O
the O

The O
bedroom O
must O
have O
looked O
grand O
at O
some O
point O
in O
time O
. O
Now O
it O
just O
looks O
a O
mess O
. O
You O
are O
beginning O
to O
feel O
quite O
disappointed O
with O
this O
tour O
. O
The O
bed O
looks O
quite O
lumpy O
, O
and O
the O
curtains O
surrounding O
the O
bed O
are O
in O
rags O
. O
A O
pile O
of O
broken O
wood O
is O
piled O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
bed O
. O
The O
ceiling B-ART
has O
a O
large O
jagged O
hole O
right O
over O
the O

You O
notice O
another O

over O
the O

A O

A O
scene O
from O

of O

it O
was O
not O

It O
is O
puzzling O
that O
the O
servant O
quarters O
would O
be O
so O
near O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
castle O
. O
Even O
making O
allowances O
for O
renovation O
efforts O
, O
you O
are O
beginning O
to O
doubt O
that O
this O
is O
a O
genuine O
Scottish O
castle O
from O
the O
12th O
Century O
to O
begin O
with O
. O
This O
servant O
quarters O
resemble O
a O
modern O
day O
military O
barracks O
, O
except O
the O
walls B-ART
were O
decorated O
with O
various O
paintings B-ART
from O

There O
are O
many O

You O
see O
mountains B-ART
to O
the O
distant B-ART
east O
. O
You O
feel O
a O
manly O
twitching O
in O
your O
thews O
, O
enlivened O
by O
the O
freedom O
of O
the O
open O
country O

buried O
shack O
of O
once O
fine O
metal O
, O
draped O
with O
canvas O
and O
pocked O
with O
rust O
. O
You O
are O
wise O
in O
the O
ways O
of O
these O
they O
are O
the O
space O
ships B-ART
that O
brought O
men O
from O
dark O
places O
in O
the O
sky O
, O
ere O
they O
fell O
. O


Much O
of O
the O
shack B-ART
has O
been O
stripped O
for O
pieces O
, O
no O
doubt O
to O
be O
sold O
in O
God O
City O
, O
far O
to O
the O
west O
. O
Only O
scraps B-ART
remain O
. O


You O
stand O
in O
a O
dismal O
swamp B-ART
, O
with O
the O
chitter O
of O
unpleasant O
life O
in O
every O
direction O
. O
Footing O
is O
torturous O
here O
, O
slowed O
by O
the O
grey O
murk B-ART
sucking O
at O
your O
sandaled B-ART
tread O
. O


The O
forest B-ART
here O
is O
mucky B-ART
and O
warm O
, O
surrounding O
a O
sinkhole B-ART
filled O
with O
iridescent B-ART
, O
gently O
glowing O
water B-ART
. O
Some O
huge O
PIPES B-ART
lead O
from O
here O
into O
the O
ground B-ART
, O
and O
they O
drip O
with O
a O
similar O
strange O
water B-ART
. O
There O
is O
a O
foul O
electric O
odor B-ART
here O
, O
and O
your O
vision O
swims O
. O
You O
can O
feel O
your O
body O
being O
overtaken O
by O
weakness O
! O


This O
is O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
great O
cliff B-ART
, O
looking O
over O
a O
vast B-ART
CHASM I-ART
to O
the O
south O
. O
The O
mists B-ART
are O
so O
heavy O
within O
that O
you O
can O
barely O
detect O
a O
raging B-ART
river I-ART
far O
, O
far O
below O
. O


A O
high O
WATERFALL B-ART
cascades O
down O
from O
a O
mountain B-ART
ridge O
above O
, O
foaming O
and O
roaring O
into O
a O
broad O
POOL B-ART
of O
clean O
water B-ART
. O
The O
result O
is O
a O
brilliant O
PRISMATIC B-ART
SPRAY I-ART
. O
The O
setting O
is O
very O
peaceful O
. O


The O
air O
is O
frigid O
, O
and O
the O
streets O
are O
completely O
empty O
there O
is O
hardly O
any O
sign B-ART
of O
life O
here O
. O
Even O
so O
, O
you O
know O
you O
are O
being O
watched O
. O
To O
your O
South O
is O
the O
Town O
Exit O
. O
To O
your O
North O
stand O
the O
Fields O
, O
showing O
obvious O
neglect O
. O
To O
your O
West O
is O
a O
Shadowed O
Alley O
; O
and O
to O
your O
East O
is O
the O
Tavern O
the O
only O
place O
that O
looks O
remotely O
welcoming O
, O
despite O
its O
crude O
build O
. O


The O
Eastern O
Dirt O
Road O
hugs O
the O
outer B-ART
perimeter O
of O
the O
castle O
and O
eventually O
joins O
the O
Western O
Dirt O
Road O
. O
The O
most O
significant O
and O
noticeable O
defect O
that O
you O
notice O
here O
is O
the O
large O
crack O
in O
the O
wall B-ART
. O
It O
runs O
all O
the O
way O
up O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
defence O
here O
only O
serves O
to O
make O
you O
rather O
uncomfortable O
. O
You'd O
wager O
that O
anyone O
determined O
enough O
could O
sneak O
into O
the O
castle O
, O
and O
remain O
undetected O
, O
if O
they O
could O
only O
climb O
up O
the O
Cracked B-ART
Wall I-ART
from O
here O
. O

The O
Castle B-ART
Path O
leads O
directly O
to O
the O
Gate B-ART
of O
Trein O
Hill O
Castle B-ART
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
way O
in O
or O
out B-ART
of O
this O
fortress O
. O
You O
find O
it O
slightly O
odd O
that O
there O
are O
no O
guards O
currently O
patrolling O
the O
area O
. O
To O
the O
North O
is O
the O
Castle B-ART

East O
of O
the O
Main O

, O
the O

is O
the O
only O
place O
that O
appears O
to O

warm O
. O
There O
are O
only O
five B-ART
people O
in O
the O
Tavern B-ART
. O
In O
one O
corner O
are O
three B-ART
men O
, O
who O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
Town O
Guards B-ART
. O
The O
Barkeep B-ART
is O
sitting O
at O
a O
table B-ART
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
, O
though O
she O
occasionally O
looks O
at O
the O
Drunkard B-ART
, O
who O
is O
closest O
to O
the O
fireplace O
. O
Only O
the O
Old O
Guard B-ART
appears O
interested O
in O
speaking O
to O
you O
. O

There O

with O
a O

around O
a O

where O
you're O

But O
at O

there's O
a O

An O

To O

Once O

Now O
it's O

looking O
up O
at O
a O

You O
quickly O
decide O
that O
this O
is O
an O
example O
of O
modern O
art B-ART
, O
something O
so O
poor O
that O
you O
could O
have O

it O
together O
in O

A O
spacious O
and O
comfortable O
room O
, O
softly O
lit O
through O
French B-ART
windows I-ART
covered O
by O
drifty O
white O
drapes B-ART
, O
and O
locked O

A O
dresser B-ART
, O
a O
bed B-ART
comfortable O
but O
comfortless O
, O
a O
goban B-ART
with O
matching O
chairs O
. O
Although O
elegant O
, O
the O
decor O
is O
somewhat O
minimalist O
in O
design O
, O
and O
you O
can't O
help O
reading O
violence O
into O
everything B-ART

This O
room B-ART
at O
the O
Inn B-ART
of O
the O
Seven O
Shields O
can O
be O
charitably O
described O
as O
economical B-ART
. O
No O
windows O
, O
filthy O
floorboards O
, O
and O
little O
in O
the O
way O
of O
furnishings O
. O
Heck O
, O
there O
isn't O
even O
a O
cot O
to O
sleep O
on O
! O
A O
single O
door B-ART
leads O
east O
. O
A O
large O
, O
travel B-ART
worn O
trunk B-ART
is O
pushed O
up O
against O
one O
wall B-ART
. O


Most O
of O
the O
floor O
space O
is O
taken O
by O
a O
rather O
large B-ART
double I-ART
bed I-ART
. O
Against O
the O
wall B-ART
is O
a O
small B-ART
table I-ART
, O
in O
front O
of O
which O
is O
a O
chair B-ART
. O
In O
one O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
is O
a O
large B-ART
closet I-ART
. O
A O
door B-ART
leads O
southwest O
. O


You O
have O
entered O
the O
largest O
room O
of O
the O
house O
. O
There O
is O
a O
fireplace B-ART
in O
one O
corner O
, O
with O
a O
bearskin B-ART
rug I-ART
in O
front O
of O
it O
. O
Also O
in O
the O
room O
are O
a O
table B-ART
, O
an O
armchair B-ART

a O

The O

door B-ART
is O
to O
the O
south O
and O
two B-ART
other O
doors B-ART
lead O
northwest O
and O
northeast O
. O


It's O
rather O
spartan O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
your O
home O
back O
in O
Canberra O
, O
but O
you're O
not O
really O
complaining O
. O
There O
is O
a O
simple O
stove B-ART
and O
a O
sink B-ART
. O
Tiles B-ART
with O
red B-ART

blue I-ART

the O

between O
the O

the O

above O
it O
. O
A O
door B-ART
leads O
southeast O
into O
the O
living O
room O

You O
are O
standing O
on O
the O
driveway O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
small B-ART
cabin I-ART
you O
and O
your O
wife O
bought O
ten B-ART
years O
ago O
, O
just O
after O
you O
were O
married O
. O
The O
cabin's B-ART
door B-ART
is O
north O
of O
here O
, O
and O
the O
road O
stretches O
away O
to O
the O
south O
. O
All O
around O
you O
, O
the O
snow O
covered O
trees O
of O
the O
Black O
Forest O
stand O
silently O
. O


You're O
standing O
on O
a O
stretch O
of O
road B-ART
by O
your O
car B-ART
. O
On O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
road B-ART
is O
nothing O
but O
flat O
, O
dry O
ground O
and O
nothing O
to O
see O
at O
all O
to O
the O
horizon O
. O
The O
sign B-ART
you O
passed O
a O
few O
miles O
back O
said O
it O
was O
about O
10 O
miles O
to O
the O
nearest O
town O
, O
the O
name O
of O
which O
you've O
already O
forgotten O
. O
Seeing O
as O
it's O
even O
farther O
back O
to O
the O
previous O
town O
, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
go O
is O
forward O
to O
the O
east O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
a O
forest B-ART
. O
Before O
you O
is O
the O
entrance B-ART
to O
an O
ancient B-ART
black I-ART
castle I-ART
. O
Huge B-ART
stone I-ART
walls I-ART
covered O
in O
moss B-ART
and O
thick O
vines B-ART
reach O
high O
into O
the O
late B-ART
afternoon I-ART
sky I-ART
. O


You O
have O
found O
the O
castle B-ART
cemetery I-ART
, O
ringed O
by O
a O
restless O
forest B-ART
. O
Old B-ART
gravestones I-ART
poke O
out B-ART
of I-ART
sour I-ART
smelling O
black B-ART
mud I-ART
like O
so O
many O
rotted O
teeth O
. O
An O
atmosphere O
of O
insufferable O
morbid O
decay O
clings O
to O
this O
most O
unholy O
of O
burial O
grounds B-ART
. O
A O
low B-ART
, I-ART
freezing I-ART
mist I-ART
covers O
the O
dank B-ART
earth I-ART
. O


The O
afternoon B-ART
light I-ART
filters O
slowly O
down O
, O
in O
long O
dusty O
columns O
, O
through O
the O
dead B-ART
and O
decaying O
forest B-ART
. O
On O
this O
gloomy O
path B-ART
, O
strange O
sounds O
echo O
around O
you O
. O
Giant O
smothering O
vines B-ART
cling O
to O
black B-ART
and O
decayed O
timber O
. O
The O
trees B-ART
creak O
and O
crack O
in O
the O
wind B-ART
of O
a O
threatening O
storm B-ART
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
small B-ART
forest I-ART
clearing I-ART
in O
the O
centre O
of O
which O
is O
a O
strange O
, O
bubbling O
pool B-ART
. O
The O
water B-ART
itself O
gives O
off O
an O
unearthly O
blue B-ART
light I-ART
. O
The O
light B-ART
dances O
in O
strange O
patterns O
over O
the O
nearby O
trees B-ART
. O
It O
must O
be O
some O
kind O
of O
rare O
phosphorescence O
. O
Large O
mosquitoes B-ART
buzz O
round O
the O
bubbling O
pond B-ART
water I-ART
. O
A O
forest B-ART
path I-ART
leads O
EAST O
. O


You O
have O
found O
a O
very O
muddy B-ART
forest B-ART
clearing I-ART
. O
The O
forest B-ART
moves O
restlessly O
around O
its O
edges O
like O
a O
cat O
waiting O
to O
pounce O
. O


You O
are O
inside O
a O
small O
, O
one O
room O
hovel O
. O
A O
cottage O
that O
is O
no O
longer O
habitable O
. O
Forest O
vines B-ART
have O
crept O
inside O
through O
broken O
windows O
and O
what O
remains O
of O
the O
roof O
. O
The O
Devil's B-ART
vine O
has O
devoured O
the O
inside O
of O
this O
little O
building O
. O
It O
is O
so O
dark O
you O
can O
hardly O
see O
. O


You O
stand O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
cottage B-ART
. O
You O
are O
surrounded O
on O
all O
sides O
by O
the O
impenetrable O
and O
restless O
forest B-ART
. O
A O
path B-ART
leads O
NORTHEAST O
to O
the O
front O
of O
the O
cottage B-ART
. O


You O
stand O
near O
the O
central B-ART
entrance O
pyramid B-ART
of O
the O
Musee O
du O
Louvre O
, O
a O
steel B-ART
and I-ART
glass I-ART
structure O
rising O
over O
twenty B-ART
meters O
into O
the O
air O
. O


The O
room B-ART
is O
small O
; O
the O
same O
as O
all O
the O
others O
. O
But O
it O
seems O
smaller O
of O
late O
. O
The O
hall O
extends O
to O
the O
west O
. O


There O
is O
little O
to O
be O
seen O
here O
but O
the O
locutory B-ART
door I-ART
to O
the O
west O
and O
your O
room B-ART
to O
the O
east O
. O
North O
and O
south O
both O
lead O
to O
the O
cold O
north O
to O
the O
cloister O
and O
south O
to O
outside B-ART
. O


The O
last O
hint O
of O
shelter O
against O
the O
outside B-ART
world O
. O
But O
it O
is O
only O
a O
hint O
. O
The O
wind O
rushes O
by O
like O
a O
stream O
of O
ice O
water O
to O
the O
south O
only O
the O
curve B-ART
of O
the O
arch B-ART
protects O
you O
. O
The O
warmth O
, O
for O
as O
much O
as O
it O
can O
be O
called O
that O
, O
of O
the O
monastery O
awaits O
to O
the O
north O
and O
the O
cold O
of O
outside B-ART
to O
the O
south O
. O


The O
locutory B-ART
used O
to O
be O
alive O
with O
the O
bartering O
of O
merchants O
and O
the O
tales O
of O
visiting O
brothers B-ART
, O
but O
since O
the O
gate O
was O
closed O
, O
no O
one O
has O
been O
in O
here O
but O
you O
. O
A O
small B-ART
bed I-ART
is O
pushed O
up O
against O
the O
wall B-ART
for O
those O
visitors O
not O
permitted O
residency O
in O
the O
monastery O
, O
its O
tired O
frame O
supporting O
a O
light B-ART
mattress I-ART
. O


In O
the O
warmer O
months O
, O
Brother B-ART
Matteo I-ART
maintains O
a O
beautiful B-ART
garden I-ART
in O
the O
cloister O
. O
Now O
there O
is O
nothing O
but O
a O
few O
dead O
vines B-ART
sticking O
out O
from O
beneath O
a O
blanket B-ART
of I-ART
snow I-ART
. O
Still O
, O
it O
has O
a O
calm O
dignity O
the O
wind O
finds O
no O
entrance O
here O
. O
The O
colonnade B-ART
is O
broken O
to O
the O
south O
by O
the O
exit O
to O
the O
hall O
and O
to O
the O
west O
by O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
refectory O
. O
The O
brothers' B-ART
dormitory O
lies O
to O
the O
east O
, O
between O
the O
calefactory O
in O
the O
southeast O
and O
the O
belltower B-ART
in O
the O
northeast O
. O


The O
only O
room B-ART
at O
Saint B-ART
Cuthbert's I-ART
large O
enough O
to O
hold O
all O
the O
brothers B-ART
, O
except O
for O
the O
church O
, O
the O
refectory O
seems O
immense O
. O
Normally O
, O
when O
you O
are O
in O
here O
the O
place B-ART
is O
alive O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
only O
movement O
is O
that O
of O
drafts O
spinning O
between O
the O
tables B-ART
and I-ART
out I-ART
to O
the O
cloister O
in O
the O
east O
. O
Row O
upon O
row O
of O
deserted O
seats B-ART
stand O
testament O
to O
the O
damage O
inflicted O
by O
the O
plague O
. O


The O
dead O
don't O
eat O
, O
or O
so O
you've O
been O
told O
. O
Still O
, O
the O
kitchen O
is O
practically O
empty O
. O
Bare B-ART
tables I-ART
stand O
with O
no O
crumbs O
on O
them O
, O
and O
a O
hatch B-ART
through O
the O
floor O
leads O
to O
the O
cellar B-ART
. O
The O
refectory O
lies O
to O
the O
north O
. O


Dozens O
of O
openings O
line O
the O
hall O
, O
each B-ART
leading O
to O
a O
separate O
cell O
, O
except O
for O
the O
west O
, O
which O
leads O
to O
the O
cloister O
. O
Although O
there O
are O
no O
doors O
, O
the O
entrances O
are O
positioned O
as O
such O
to O
afford O
as O
much O
privacy O
as O
possible O

Drogo's O
newly O

Constantin's B-ART

Lucca's B-ART

Constantin O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
brothers B-ART
with O
anything O
in O
his O
room B-ART
besides O
a O
bed B-ART
. O
A O
few O
tools B-ART
lay O
next O
to O
the O
door O
in O
the O
northwest O
; O
remnants O
of O
his O
life O
as O
a O
blacksmith B-ART
. O
A O
smell O
lingers O
here O
a O
sour O
smell O
. O


This O
room B-ART
is O
small O
the O
same O
as O
all O
the O
others O
. O
A O
bed B-ART

pushed O
up O

pushed O
up O

He O
seems O
to O
have O
made O
himself B-ART
right O
at O
home O

The O
room B-ART
smells O
of O
animals O
and O
sweat O
; O
scratches B-ART
adorn O
the O
bed B-ART
and O
lead O
out B-ART
the O
door O

Ignatius's O
room B-ART
does O
not O
smell O
as O
strongly O
as O
the O
others O
. O
He O
has O
spent O
so O
much O
time O
in O
the O
infirmary O
of O
late O

taking O
care O
of O
the O

He O
is O
a O

you O

Perhaps O
this O
is O
the O
only O
place B-ART
at O
Saint B-ART
Cuthbert's I-ART
that O
is O
a O
comfortable O
temperature O
. O
Heat O
blasts O
at O
you O
from O
the O

it O
is O
countered O
by O
the O

Positioned O
directly O
between O
the O
dormitory O

your O
own O
room B-ART

the O
calefactory B-ART
warms O
both O
, O
although O
lately O
it O
is O
less O
than O
adequate O

While O
the O
calefactory B-ART
itself O
is O
stiflingly O
hot O

its O
heat O
stays O

spent O
many B-ART
a O
solemn O
Mass O
up O
here O

gazing O
out B-ART
unto O
a O
sea O
of O
your O

all O

a O

We O
like O
to O
play O

dance O
in O
this O
place B-ART
around O
the O
tall O
beech B-ART
, O
sometimes O
putting O
garlands B-ART

It's O
a O
beautiful O
place B-ART
, O
with O
the O
tree B-ART
and O
the O
fountain B-ART
and O
all O
. O
. O
. O
some O
say O
it's O
even O
frequented O
by O
the O
fairies O
, O
which O
is O
why O
they O
also O
call O
it O
the O
Fairies' B-ART
Tree I-ART
, O
but O
I've O
never O
seen O
them O
myself O
. O
Nor O
have O
I O
ventured O
alone O
much O
to O
the O
south O
of O
here O
the O
town B-ART
of I-ART
Domremy I-ART
is O
to O
the O
north O
. O


This O
town B-ART
is O
where O
I O
was O
born O
, O
me O
and O
my O
brothers O
and O
sister O
and O
where O
I O
lived O
my O
entire O
life O
. O
My O
house B-ART
is O
further O
away O
to O
the O
west O
; O
so O
are O
the O
houses B-ART
of O
some O
of O
my O
friends B-ART
like O
Mengette B-ART
and O
Colin O
. O
The O
church B-ART
is O
in O
the O
east O
the O
road O
to O
the O

leads O
to O
the O
meadow O

where O
we O
came O
from O

The O
Handheld B-ART
Lounge I-ART
as O
it's O
labeled O
on O
your O
map O
is O
just O
a O
long O
hallway B-ART
, O
really O
. O
There O
are O
bean O
bag B-ART
bed I-ART
things O
lining O
one O
side O
, O
upon O
which O
recline O
a O
variety O
of O
geeks B-ART
. O
Along O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
corridor O
is O
a O
line B-ART
of I-ART
queueing I-ART
people B-ART
. O


It O
seems O
a O
bit O
odd O
to O
see O
a O
large O
fountain B-ART
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
cemetery O
, O
but O
here O
it O
stands O
. O
There O
is O
a O
statue B-ART
of O
a O
man O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
fountain B-ART
, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
people O
toss O
coins B-ART
in O
the O
water B-ART
for O
good O
luck O
. O
Gravesites O
are O
to O
the O
north O

You O
see O
a O

You O

go O
north O

You O
are O
standing O
outside B-ART
a O
tool O
shed B-ART
in O
the O
northwest O
corner O
of O
the O
cemetery O
. O
The O
shed B-ART
seems O
rickety O
, O
but O
it's O
strong O
enough O
to O
keep O
somebody O
from O
breaking O
in O
. O
The O
shed B-ART
door I-ART
is O
the O
only O
thing O
preventing O
you O
from O
all O
sorts O
of O
handy O
tools O
. O
You O
need O
to O
go O
west O
to O
get O
into O
the O
shed B-ART
. O
You O
can O
go O
east O
to O
a O
gravesite O
. O


This O
is O
a O
gate B-ART

The O

The O
park O
is O
a O
most O
excellent O
place O
for O
a O
walk O
. O
At O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
word O
walk O
, O
Dogbert B-ART
jumps O
up O

This O

your O
small O

private O

with O
gold O
, O
blue O

black O

white O
coloring O
the O
room O
. O
A O
pleasing O
little O
room O
in O
a O
once O
familiar O
space O
station O
that's O
now O
so O
strange O
and O
unsettling O
. O
You O
can O
see O
a O
bookcase B-ART
here O
. O


This O
is O
a O
modest O
bathroom O
with O
doorways O
leading O
east O
and O
southeast O
. O
You O
can O
see O
a O
sink B-ART
and O
a O
toilet B-ART
here O
. O


The O
concrete B-ART
walls I-ART
of O
this O
closet O
are O
oppressively O
close O
, O
made O
more O
so O
by O
the O
smell O
of O
bleach B-ART
and I-ART
chemicals I-ART
coming O
from O
a O
filthy B-ART
shelf I-ART
against O
the O
far O
wall O
. O
Various O
brooms B-ART
clutter O
the O
room O
, O
displaying O
none O
of O
the O
pleasant O
tidiness O
characteristic O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Pine O
Meadows O
. O
All O
this O
can O
be O
escaped O
through O
a O
door B-ART
to O
the O
south O

The O
picnic O
is O
going O
full O
blast O
, O
which O
is O
exactly O
why O
you've O
wandered O
away O
from O
it O
. O
It's O
not O
that O
you O
don't O
like O
your O
new O
companions O
; O
it's O
just O
that O
after O
weeks O
of O
spending O
each O
day O
around O
them O
, O
a O
noisy O
weekend O
cook B-ART
out I-ART
isn't O
the O
way O
to O
relax O
. O
Some O
exploration O
on O
your O
own O
is O
an O
appealing O
thought O
. O


The O
grasses O
are O
fragrant O
under O
the O
sunshine B-ART
of O
a O
late O
, O
late O
summer O
afternoon O

A O
stream B-ART
chatters O
by O
at O
your O
feet O
, O
and O
a O
weathered B-ART
old O
wooden B-ART
bridge I-ART
stretches O
across O
it O

Beyond O

a O

A O

the O

The O
old O

Elsewhere O
in O
the O
park O

flowers B-ART
lie O
in O
hollows O
and O
peek O
out O
from O
under O
the O
brush O

Here O
you O
have O
found O
a O
profusion O
of O

Sprays O

A O

You O

the O

burn O
in O
the O
incredible O

The O
crimson O

by O
a O

a O

The O

it O

Baezil B-ART

you O

the O

the O

you O

you O
hear O
the O

of O
the O

You O
stand O
at O
the O
southern O
end O

the O
small O

To O
the O
west O
lies O
Borthur's B-ART

your O

You O
can O

the O
heat O
of O
the O

within O
wafting O
from O
the O

To O
the O

lies O
Mayor O

To O
the O
south O
the O
road B-ART
ends O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
small O
field O

and O
beyond O
you O
see O
the O
great O
Forest O
of O
Ansalon O

Standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
forest O

sticking O
up O
through O
the O

the O

This O

both O
the O

the O
house B-ART
you O
live O
in O
. O
Borthur B-ART
lives O
in O
the O
small B-ART
room O
upstairs O
. O
The O
house B-ART
is O
always O
intensely O
hot O
, O
but O
your O
years O
of O
work O
have O
left O
you O
immune O
to O
the O
scorching O
heat O
. O
The O
forge B-ART
and I-ART
workplace I-ART
lie O
across O
from O
your O
bed B-ART
and I-ART
sparse I-ART
accommodations O
, O
and O
a O
staircase B-ART
leads O
up O
to O
Borthur's B-ART
quarters O
. O


This O
is O
the O
home B-ART
of O
the O
mayor B-ART
and O
his O
wife B-ART
, O
and O
the O
place O
where O
all O
the O
town O
meetings O
are O
held O
. O
The O
fireplace B-ART
and I-ART
brick I-ART
chimney I-ART
give O
the O
room O
a O
quaint O
coziness O
, O
and O
it O
is O
never O
too O
hot O
or O
too O
cold O
. O
You O
have O
spent O
many B-ART
days B-ART
sitting O
by O
the O
fire B-ART
and O
talking O
to O
Idah B-ART
, O
who O
never O
bores O
you O
with O
her O
many B-ART
tales O
. O


You O
stand O
in O
a O
small O
field B-ART
overlooking O
the O
surrounding O
countryside O
south O
of O
the O
town B-ART
. O
Rolling O
hills B-ART
stretch O
southwest O
until O
they O
meet O
with O
the O
tree B-ART
covered O
Tysis B-ART
Mountains I-ART
. O
Standing O
before O
the O
mountains B-ART
, O
almost O
matching O
their O
height O
, O
looms O
the O
tower B-ART
of O
Nostrophidius O
. O
To O
the O
southeast O
, O
the O
great O
forest B-ART
of I-ART
Ansalon I-ART
stretches O
to O
the O
horizon O
. O


You O
stand O
among O
tree B-ART
covered O
hills B-ART
which O
disorient O
your O
sense O
of O
direction O
and O
blur O
your O
vision O
. O
You O
think O
to O
the O
northwest O
you O
can O
see O
a O
rough O
path B-ART
heading O
up O
one O
of O
the O
larger O
hills B-ART
. O
To O
the O
northeast O
you O
can O
barely O
see O
the O
field B-ART
south O
of O
town O
through O
the O
treetops B-ART
. O


You O
now O
walk O
on O
a O
small O
path B-ART
which O
winds O
around O
the O
hills B-ART
, O
but O
you O
can O
sense O
it O
gradually O
gains O
altitude O
as O
it O
continues O
on O
. O
There O
is O
a O
break O
in O
the O
smaller O
hills B-ART
to O
the O
southeast O
, O
and O
to O
the O
south O
the O
path B-ART
continues O
up O
a O
hill B-ART
that's O
almost O
big B-ART
enough O
to O
be O
a O
mountain B-ART
. O


The O
easy O
forest B-ART
path I-ART
here O
is O
well O
worn O
from O
use O
by O
the O
townspeople O
and O
forest B-ART
animals O
. O
To O
the O
east O
the O
path B-ART
has O
a O
smaller O
, O
lesser O
used O
split O
, O
rounding O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O
The O
latter O
path B-ART
goes O
far O
deeper O
into O
the O
forest B-ART
while O
the O
main O
path B-ART
to O
the O
east O
skirts O
around O
the O
edge O
. O


You O
are O
over O
halfway O
up O
the O
steep O
hill B-ART
. O
Below O
you O
can O
see O
the O
forest B-ART
, I-ART
hills I-ART
and O
town O
, O
but O
you O
try O
to O
keep O
looking O
up O
to O
keep O
the O
thought O
of O
falling O
from O
your O
mind O
. O
Above O
you O
the O
trees B-ART
begin O
to O
thin O
out O
, O
and O
the O
path B-ART
gets O
more O
rocky O
. O
At O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hill B-ART
you O
can O
make O
out O
the O

You O
are O
almost O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
giant O
hill B-ART
upon O
which O
lies O
the O
tower B-ART
of O
Nostrophidius O
. O
The O
way O
here O
is O
difficult O
, O
and O
it's O
growing O
harder O
to O
catch O
your O
breath O
at O
this O
height O
. O
All O
you O
can O
see O
below O
is O
a O
blanket O
of O
green O
, O
the O
southern O
forest B-ART
. O
You O
can't O
make O
out O
the O
town O
from O
this O
height O
, O
which O
shows O
you O
how O
high O
up O
you O
actually O
are O
. O
You O
feel O
severely O
ill O
, O
and O
your O
legs O
are O
turning O
to O
jelly O
. O
You O
hate O
being O
up O
high O
! O


This O
is O
the O
reception O
area O
. O
There O
is O
a O
sign B-ART
here O
, O
and O
a O
podium B-ART
, O
on O
which O
sits O
a O
bell B-ART
. O
There O
is O
also O
a O
small O
waiting O
area O
with O
four B-ART
low O
chairs B-ART
and O
a O
coffee B-ART
table I-ART
. O
The O
door B-ART
to O
the O
main O
office O
lies O
to O
the O
west O
. O
On O
the O
coffee B-ART
table I-ART
is O
a O
copy O
of O
God's B-ART
Rude I-ART
Wireless I-ART
. O


You O
are O
walking O
along O
a O
well O
trodden O
path B-ART
surrounded O
by O
forest B-ART
. O
Birds B-ART
are O
singing O
and O
a O
gentle O
breeze B-ART
sways O
the O
branches B-ART
of O
the O
trees B-ART
. O


You O
are O
on O
a O
path B-ART
beside O
a O
stream B-ART
. O
The O
path B-ART
ends O
abruptly O
in O
front O
of O
you O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
continue O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
stream B-ART
. O
The O
water B-ART
flows O
quickly O
here O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
far O
off O
rapids O
can O
be O
heard O
. O


The O
water B-ART
, O
a O
gaping O
river O
now O
, O
flows O
quickly O
and O
the O
thunder O
of O
far O
off O
rapids O
can O
be O
heard O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
a O
small O
tunnel B-ART
opening I-ART
, O
which O
leads O
down O
. O
Light B-ART
streams O
from O
within O
it O
. O
A O
sign B-ART
above I-ART
reads O
' O
Underground' B-ART
. O
An O
arrow B-ART
points O
down O
. O


This O
is O
quite O
an O
ordinary O
bank B-ART
room I-ART
. O
It O
is O
tastefully O
furnished O
with O
green B-ART
plants I-ART
and O
there O
is O
a O
long O
wooden O
counter B-ART
which O
has O
a O
thick O
glass O
screen B-ART
on O
it O
separating O
the O
teller B-ART
from O
the O
customers O
. O
There O
is O
a O
staircase O
, O
discretely O
hidden O
behind O
some O
plants B-ART
by O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
leading O
down O
. O
There O
is O
also O
a O
slightly O
separated O
children's O
corner O
to O
the O
east O
. O
Next O
to O
the O
wall B-ART
is O
a O
trashcan B-ART
. O
The O
room B-ART
is O
crowded O
with O
unpatient O
customers O
waiting O
to O
go O
about O
their O
business O
. O


There O
are O
Plexiglas B-ART
walls I-ART
thanks O
to O
which O
this O
corner B-ART
of O
the O
bank O
is O
surprisingly O
silent O
. O
In O
reality O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
walls B-ART
is O
probably O
the O
converse O
in O
that O
their O
presence O
makes O
the O
bank O
more O
quiet O
. O
There O
is O
a O
yellow B-ART
toybox I-ART
on O
the O
floor O
and O
there O
are O
toys B-ART
scattered O
all O
around O
. O
You O
can O
also O
see O
a O
Mickey B-ART
Mouse I-ART
clock I-ART
on O
the O
wall B-ART
. O


This O
is O
the O
entrance O
of O
Minuteman O
Foods O
. O
A O
vast O
array O
of O
aisles B-ART
spread O
out B-ART
in O
either O
direction O
. O


As O
opposed O
to O
say O
, O
a O
military O
or O
executive O
shuttle O
, O
which O
would O
have O
seats O
to O
make O
the O
trip O
comfortable O
and O
an O
in O
flight O
holomovie O
to O
ease O
the O
tedium O
of O
a O
three B-ART
hour O
flight O
from O
Shanghai O
. O
Instead O
, O
this O
is O
the O
basic O
civvie O
model O
you're O
densely O
packed O
in O
a O
titanium B-ART
can O
with O
over O
fifty O
other O
Chinese O
immigrants B-ART
. O
The O
cabin O
reeks O
of O
sweat O
but O
there O
is O
nowhere O
to O
go O
, O
and O
at O
this O
altitude O
, O
opening O
the O
viewing B-ART
windows I-ART
would O
be O
the O
queen O
of O
bad O
ideas O
. O


Murmuring O
lowly O
, O
murmuring O

By O
the O

lone I-ART

Their O
sad B-ART

, I-ART
sad I-ART

With O
the O

of O
the O
lolling B-ART

This O
unfolds O
before O
your O
eyes O
A O
pumpkin B-ART
on O
a O
table B-ART
lies O
. O


Between O
the O
train B-ART
tracks I-ART
and O
the O
softball B-ART
field I-ART
there's O
barely O
any O
room O
for O
a O
trail B-ART
, O
and O
the O
bike B-ART
rack I-ART
here O
is O
almost O
lost O
in O
the O
overgrowth B-ART
. O
Presumably O
somebody O
will O
come O
by O
at O
some O
point O
and O
prune O
the O
bushes B-ART
, O
but O
today O
you're O
the O
only O
one O
around O
. O


The O
bike O
trail B-ART
turns O
here O
, O
giving O
as O
wide O
a O
berth O
as O
possible O
to O
both B-ART
the O
softball B-ART
field I-ART
and O
the O
woods B-ART
. O
Cradled O
in O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
asphalt B-ART
is O
a O
pool B-ART
of I-ART
rainwater I-ART
. O


What O
seemed O
at O
first O
to O
be O
a O
clear O
path O
has O
revealed O
itself O
as O
a O
clinging O
morass B-ART
. O
The O
mud B-ART
squeaks O
angrily O
every O
time O
you O
lift O
a O
foot O
; O
when O
you O
step O
down O
, O
it O
rises O
up O
to O
your O
ankles O
. O
Occasionally O
it O
slips O
beneath O
you O
, O
and O
you're O
forced O
to O
swing O
your O
arms O
in O
the O
air O
like O
an O
idiot O
to O
avoid O
falling O
on O
your O
face O
in O
the O
muck B-ART
. O


The O
stream B-ART
runs O
out O
of O
a O
culvert B-ART
here O
, O
from O
beneath O
the O
hill O
and O
the O
train B-ART
tracks I-ART
to O
the O
west O
. O
The O
runoff O
from O
last O
night's O
storm O
flows O
swiftly O
and O
musically O
. O


Here O
is O
where O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
outfield B-ART
fence B-ART
gets O
close O
to O
a O
small O
rise O
in O
the O
bike O
path B-ART
. O
The O
incline B-ART
is O
such O
that O
the O
asphalt B-ART
is O
a O
little O
drier O
here O
than O
it O
is O
to O
the O
east O
or O
west O
. O


The O
bike O
trail B-ART
turns O
from O
west O
to O
south O
here O
, O
and O
outside B-ART
the O
curve O
is O
a O
cozy B-ART
bench I-ART
, O
which O
for O
whatever O
reason O
sits O
facing O
east O
, O
toward O
the O
highway B-ART
. O


It's O
theoretically O
possible O
to O
get O
across O
the O
highway B-ART
here O
, O
but O
you O
have O
yet O
to O
see O
it O
done O
. O
The O
white B-ART
lines O
of O
the O
crosswalk B-ART
are O
more O
like O
a O
blueprint O
for O
an O
imaginary O
bridge O
. O


You O
find O
yourself B-ART
in O
a O
low O
, O
damp O
area O
, O
partially O
hidden O
from O
the O
road B-ART
above O
. O
The O
stream B-ART
runs O
out B-ART
of O
the O
woods B-ART
here O
and O
noisily O
disappears O
into O
a O
grate B-ART
under O
the O
highway B-ART
. O


This O
clearing O
is O
bounded O
by O
a O
fallen B-ART
log I-ART
on O
the O
west O
side O
and O
a O
boulder B-ART
on O
the O
other O
. O
The O
ground B-ART
around O
the O
rock B-ART
is O
littered O
with O
shards B-ART
of I-ART
glass I-ART
; O
even O
with O
shoes B-ART
on O
, O
you O
watch O
your O
steps O
carefully O
. O


The O
bushes B-ART
thin O
out B-ART
near O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hill O
, O
and O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
clearing O
is O
a O
small O
tent B-ART
. O


A O
single O
beam O
of O
sunlight O
cuts O
through O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
western O
wall O
, O
illuminating O
a O
shambolic O
mass O
of O
books B-ART
, I-ART
notepads I-ART
, I-ART
and I-ART
newspapers I-ART
strewn O
across O
the O
floor O
. O
Everything B-ART
is O
stained O
and O
crumpled O
by O
moisture O
to O
some O
degree O
. O


You O
look O
ahead O
with O
a O
scrunched O
up O
neck O
and O
fail O
to O
keep O
your O
shoes B-ART
out I-ART
of O
the O
water B-ART
. O
The O
curved B-ART
floor O
is O
harder O
to O
walk O
on O
than O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
. O


Well O
, O
looks O
like O
you've O
been O
reluctantly O
nominated O
. O
If O
you O
survive O
the O
fall O
, O
you O
might O
get O
a O
chance O
to O
solve O
these O
mysteries B-ART
. O
. O
. O
and O
maybe O
win O
a O
Pulitzer O
Prize O
to O
boot O
! O
You've O
been O
falling O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
it's O
almost O
time O
to O
land O
. O
. O
. O
for O
better O
or O
for O
worse O
. O

Some O
of O
the O

been O
scraped B-ART
off O
the O
wall B-ART
, O
but O
it O
is O
slowly B-ART
growing O
back O

The O
roof O
of O
the O

is O
too O
high O
for O
you O
to O
see O
. O
A O
ridge B-ART
of I-ART
stone I-ART
, O
almost O
like O
a O

extends O

here O
you O

the O

the O
XYZZY O

Unfortunately O
, O
you O
can't O
see O
what O
it O
looks O
like O
, O
because O
I O
don't O
know O
, O
not O

all O

But O
there's O
a O
trapdoor B-ART
in O
the O
ceiling O
which O
leads O
to O
the O
part O

which O
is O
actually O
backstage O

screw O
it O

I O
don't O

The O

at O
the O
mouth B-ART
of O
a O
deep O
cave O

The O
light O
from O
several O

it O

back O

the O
tonnes O

precious I-ART

The O
Hairy B-ART
Horseman I-ART
tavern B-ART
squats O
along O
the O
cobbled O
street O
beside O
the O
north O

out O
of O

The O
low O

enticingly O

The O

here O
beneath O
the O
tall O

The O
crush O

Outside O
the O
village B-ART
the O
road B-ART
turns O
eastward O
into O
gentle O
farmland B-ART

The O
village B-ART
lies O
south O
, O
and O
a O
narrow O
gap O
leads O
into O
the O
forest B-ART
to O
the O
north O

The O
forest B-ART
edge O
is O
thick O
with O
saplings B-ART

A O
gap O
leads O
out O
into O
bright O

to O
the O
south O

the O

Faint O

a O
thicket B-ART
of I-ART
beech I-ART

Mouldering O
leaves B-ART
lie O
thick O
on O
the O

this O
spot O
an O
eerie O

silence O

The O
air O
is O
still O
and O
warm O
here O
beneath O
a O
thicket B-ART
of O
young O
alders B-ART
which O
green O
tint O
the O
dappled O
sunlight O
so O
that O
it O

Paths O
wind O
down O
from O
the O
west O

south O
, O
entering O
the O
dull O
gray O

of O
the O
swamp B-ART

Huge O
willows B-ART
draped O
with O
sickly O
tendrils O
of O
moss B-ART
stoop O
low O
over O
the O
oily O
mud B-ART

A O
broad O
rocky B-ART
shelf B-ART
stretches O
along O
the O
cliff B-ART
top I-ART
here O
, O
free O
from O
vegetation O
. O
There O
are O
panoramic O
views B-ART
over O
the O
valley B-ART
, O
where O
the O
distant O
mountains B-ART
dissolve O
into O
a O
hazy O
wetland B-ART
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
cliff B-ART

Gaps O
lead O
back O
into O
the O
forest B-ART
to O
the O
south O

, O
while O
a O
rocky B-ART
path B-ART
from O
the O

descends O
eastward O
toward O
the O

Just O
ahead O
, O
the O
river B-ART
emerges O
from O
a O
rocky B-ART
gorge B-ART
to O
the O
west O
and O
plunges O
from O
a O
spray O
misted O
lip B-ART
into O
the O
swamp B-ART
far O
below O

A O
jagged O
tooth O
of O
rock B-ART
is O
all O
that O
remains O
of O
the O
bridge B-ART
that O
must O

The O
forest B-ART

the O
cliff B-ART
top I-ART

A O
huge O
oak B-ART
towers O
above O
the O
surrounding O
forest B-ART
, O
creating O
a O
vast O
green O
lit O
cathedral B-ART
beneath O

Trails O
lead O
off O
to O
the O
north O
, O
south O
, O
west O

, O
or O
you O
might O
be O
able O
to O
scramble O
up O
the O
trunk B-ART
by O

of O
its O
many O
gnarls B-ART
and I-ART

The O
ceiling B-ART
of I-ART
leaves I-ART
opens O
here O
to O
a O
sunny O
clearing O
with O
exits O
in O
the O
four O
cardinal O
directions O
. O


The O
rising O
ground B-ART
here O
becomes O
quite O
rocky B-ART

Amid O
stunted O
birches B-ART
gapes O
the O
dark O
mouth B-ART
of O
an O
abandoned O
mine B-ART

Traces O
of O
paths B-ART
lead O
back O
to O
the O
east O

The O
forest B-ART
ends O
here O
at O
the O
edge B-ART
of O
a O
precipitous O
gorge B-ART
from O
which O
the O
river B-ART
roars O
and O
thrashes O

A O
fallen B-ART
log B-ART
provides O
a O
way O
north O
across O
the O

This O
small O

You O
weren't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
the O
mystic B-ART
valley O
of O
Shangri O
La O
. O
You'd O
heard O
all O
the O
stories O
of O
course O
a O
land O
of O
mystery O
and O
matchless O
beauty O
where O
life O
is O
lived O
in O
tranquil O
wonder O
, O
beyond O
the O
grasp O
of O
a O
doomed O
world O
! O
That's O
what O
it O
said O
in O
the O
brochure O
, O
anyway O
. O
. O
. O


That O
you O
are O
standing O
outside B-ART
the O
caravan B-ART
of O
one O
of O
Shangri O
La's O
permanent O
residents O
is O
evidenced O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
a O
tiny O
section O
of O
garden B-ART
has O
been O
fenced B-ART
off O
. O
The O
garden B-ART
consists O
of O
a O
small O
patch O
of O
meticulously O
raked O
gravel B-ART
, O
with O
, O
placed O
at O
harmonious O
intervals O
, O
two O
potted O
bonsai B-ART
trees I-ART
, O
three O
garden B-ART
gnomes I-ART
all O
in O
the O
lotus O
position O
and O
the O
inevitable O
plastic B-ART
flamingo I-ART
. O
The O
door B-ART
to O
the O
caravan B-ART
is O
open O
, O
revealing O
a O
curtain B-ART
of O
colourful O
plastic B-ART
ribbons I-ART
that O
flutter O
in O
the O
breeze O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
glacier B-ART
, O
a O
sheer O
wall O
of O
ice B-ART
that O
would O
dwarf O
the O
tallest O
skyscraper O
. O
For O
thousands O
of O
years O
it O
has O
followed O
this O
valley O
like O
the O
world's O
most O
doggedly O
determined O
Slush B-ART
Puppie I-ART
. O
Scattered O
around O
are O
immense O
boulders B-ART
deposited O
here O
by O
the O
glacier B-ART
during O
its O
inexorable O
retreat O
. O
Who O
knows O
what O
else O
might O
have O
been O
swept O
up O
in O
this O
monstrous O
river O
of O
ice B-ART
? O


Here O
, O
in O
the O
foothills O
of O
the O
mountains B-ART
is O
a O
meadow O
of O
lush O
grass B-ART
, O
strewn O
with O
boulders B-ART
and O
dotted O
with O
tall O
wild O
flowers B-ART
that O
frug O
and O
shimmy O
in O
the O
breeze O
. O
A O
pastoral O
idyll O
in O
other O
words O
, O
marred O
only O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
someone O
has O
erected O
a O
barn B-ART
smack O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it O
. O
A O
windowless O
wooden O
box B-ART
, O
this O
barn B-ART
, O
of O
no O
great O
architectural O
merit O
. O
Daubed O
above O
the O
entrance O
are O
the O
words O
Yak O
Shed B-ART
. O


Here O
, O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
mountain B-ART
you O
are O
at O
last O
fully O
able O
to O
appreciate O
its O
immense O
size O
. O
A O
rough O
, O
twisting O
path B-ART
becomes O
a O
narrow O
traverse B-ART
that O
zig O
zags O
its O
way O
up O
the O
mountainside B-ART
, O
its O
summit O
obscured O
by O
mist B-ART
. O


The O
inside O
of O
this O
tiny O
caravan O
is O
completely O
bare O
as O
befits O
a O
monk's B-ART
cell O
. O
Only O
the O
fitted O
furniture B-ART
remains O
, O
and O
presumably O
its O
owner's O
few O
possessions O
are O
secreted O
away O
in O
the O
handy O
under O
seat B-ART
storage I-ART
areas O
. O
The O
only O
other O
feature O
is O
the O
colourful O
ribbon B-ART
curtain I-ART
through O
which O
you O
entered O
. O


Here O
, O
at O
the O
peak O
of O
the O
mountain O
, O
perched O
beneath O
a O
snow O

is O
a O

Mystic B-ART

flap O
from O

tied O
to O
the O

Could O
it O
be O
that O
you O
have O
finally O
found O
the O
fabled O

The O
ballroom O
chosen O
for O
the O
2003 O
Xyzzy O
Awards O
has O
been O
decorated O
in O
luxurious O
style O
gold B-ART
leaf I-ART
marks O
the O
wainscoting B-ART
below O
the O
paintings B-ART
of I-ART
famous I-ART
IF O
scenes B-ART
, O
while O
the O
ceiling B-ART
has O
a O
elaborate O
mural B-ART
depicting O
the O
History O
of O
the O
Implementors O
. O
Elegantly O
clad O
waiters B-ART
glide O
here O
and O
there O
serving O
canapes B-ART
off O
silver O
platters O
, O
but O
all O
eyes O
eventually O
return O
to O
the O
stage B-ART
up O
front O
and O
its O
velvet O
curtain B-ART
. O


In O
the O
flickering O
torchlight O
, O
you O
can O
make O
out B-ART
large O
pieces O
of O
metal O
in O
the O
room O
. O


The O
ceiling O
of O
the O
room O
is O
made O
to O
mimic O
the O
constellations O
. O
There O
are O
a O
multitude O
of O
gems B-ART
embedded O
into O
the O
ceiling O
, O
each B-ART
flicking O
with O
light O
as O
if O
they O
are O
stars B-ART
. O
Some O
are O
larger O
than O
others O
, O
some O
or O
smaller O
. O
Most O
give O
off O
a O
yellow O
glow O
, O
but O
there O
are O
a O
few O
red O
and O
blue O
and O
white O
. O
If O
only O
you O
had O
paid O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
stars B-ART
. O
. O
. O


You O
are O
in O
a O
brightly O
colored O
room O
, O
full O
of O
unimplemented O
decorations B-ART
. O


This O
is O
where O
Drew B-ART
does O
his O
stuff B-ART
and O
generally O
hangs O
out B-ART
. O
Vague O
piles B-ART
of I-ART
junk I-ART
lurk O
in O
the O
corners O
. O
The O
ceiling B-ART
roils O
with O
a O
cloud B-ART
of O
thin O
smoke B-ART
, O
which O
spills O
out B-ART
of O
the O
room O
through O
the O
doorway O
to O
the O
south O
. O


A O
sizeable O
network O
of O
tunnels B-ART
leading O
to O
the O
hidey O
holes O
of O
your O
fellow O
rats O
branch O
off O
from O
this O
central O
cavity O
. O
This O
is O
an O
older O
neighborhood O
, O
and O
the O
struts B-ART
and I-ART
archways I-ART
supporting O
the O
walls B-ART
are O
cobbled O
together O
in O
an O
architectural B-ART
patchwork B-ART
that O
would O
say O
building O
code O
violation O
to O
an O
Above O
Dweller O
, O
but O
to O
you O
it O
says O
home O
. O


These O
tunnels O
were O
built O
by O
humans O
like O
a O
hundred O
years O
ago O
to O
maintain O
the O
pipes B-ART
that O
move O
pressurized O
steam B-ART
from O
their O
big O
fancy O
power O
plant O
to O
all O
their O
big O
fancy O
buildings O
. O
Even O
close O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
the O
air O
in O
here O
is O
uncomfortably O
warm O
for O
humans O
, O
with O
their O
big O
fancy O
heads O
up O
near O
the O
ceilings O
, O
it's O
probably O
unbearable O
. O
The O
arched O
walls B-ART
are O
made O
out B-ART
of O
cracked O
, O
ancient O
bricks B-ART
that O
would O
be O
fun O
to O
climb O
if O
they O
weren't O
lined O
with O
all O
those O
steam B-ART
pipes I-ART
. O


It's O
about O
lunch O
time O
, O
and O
a O
few O
rays O
of O
sunlight O
fall O
directly O
through O
the O
access O
grate B-ART
above O
you O
. O
A O
ladder B-ART
underneath O
conveniently O
allows O
the O
climber O
to O
avoid O
contact O
with O
the O
steam B-ART
pipes I-ART
. O


Here O
the O
tunnel O
curves O
away O
to O
the O
southeast O
and O
southwest O
. O
A O
tall O
ladder B-ART
leads O
up O
and O
out B-ART
of O
sight O
. O


This O
well O
traveled O
juncture O
is O
where O
the O
local O
steam B-ART
tunnel O
system O
links O
up O
with O
the O
main O
network O
, O
eventually O
leading O
back O
to O
the O
power O
plant O
. O


This O
is O
the O
darkest O
corner O
of O
the O
tunnels O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
forgotten O
even O
by O
the O
maintenance O
staff O
. O
The O
floor O
is O
thickly O
matted O
with O
dead O
and O
rotting O
leaves B-ART
. O


The O
nice O
thing O
about O
your O
own O
place O
is O
that O
everything B-ART
is O
exactly O
where O
it O
should O
be O
. O
Other O
people's O
burrows O
are O
always O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
off O
, O
you O
know O
? O
But O
even O
if O
your O
home O
is O
a O
dirty O
little O
hole O
in O
the O
ground O
, O
at O
least O
you O
can O
keep O
it O
the O
way O
you O
like O
it O
. O


Inside O
Shack B-ART
The O
inside O
of O
the O
shack B-ART
is O
a O
shambles O
. O
An O
overturned O
table B-ART
and I-ART
bench I-ART
, O
and O
a O
few O
broken O
windows B-ART
remain O
. O
An O
oven B-ART
is O
the O
only O
fixture B-ART
that's O
even O
recognizable O
. O


You O
hear O
a O
rustling O
in O
the O
brambles B-ART
nearby O
, O
and O
you O
catch O
a O
glimpse O
of O
something O
small O
and O
furry O
as O
it O
scurries O
away O
. O


Shady O

This O

an O

A O
rubber B-ART
mat I-ART
saying O

lies O
by O
the O

There O
is O
no O

here O
, O
and O
all O
the O

are O
barred O
. O


One O
particularly O
large B-ART
tree I-ART
with O
some O
low O
branches O
stands O
here O
. O


There O
is O
a O
pile B-ART
of I-ART
leaves I-ART
on O
the O
ground O
. O


This O
is O
a O
forest O
, O
with O
trees B-ART
in O
all O
directions O
around O
you O
. O


On O
the O
branch O
is O
a O
small B-ART
birds I-ART
nest I-ART
. O
In O
the O
bird's O
nest B-ART
is O
a O
large B-ART
egg I-ART
encrusted I-ART
with O
precious O
jewels O
, O
apparently O
scavenged O
somewhere O
by O
a O
childless O
songbird B-ART
. O


Unlike O
most O
eggs B-ART
, O
this O
one O
is O
hinged O
and O
has O
a O
delicate O
looking O
clasp O
holding O
it O
closed O
. O


You O
are O
about O
10 O
feet O
above O
the O
ground O
nestled B-ART
among O
some O
large B-ART
branches O
. O
The O
nearest O
branch O
above O
you O
is O
above O
your O
reach O
. O


You O
hear O
in O
the O
distance O
the O
chirping O
of O
a O
song B-ART
bird O
. O


You O
are O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Great O
Canyon O
on O
its O
south O
wall B-ART

Across O
the O
canyon O
, O
the O
walls B-ART
of O
the O
White O
Cliffs B-ART
still O
appear O
to O
loom O
far O
above O

Following O
the O
Canyon O
upstream O
north O
and O
northwest O
, O
Aragain O
Falls O
may O
be O
seen O
, O
complete O
with O
rainbow O

Fortunately O
, O
my O
vision O
is O
better O
than O
average O
and O
I O
can O
discern O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Flood O
Control O

3 O
far O
to O
the O
distant O
north O
. O


Above O
you O
is O
more O
cliff B-ART

which O
still O
appears O
climbable O
. O


You O
are O
facing O
the O
south O
side O
of O
a O
white B-ART
house I-ART
. O


A O
rainbow B-ART
crosses I-ART
over O
the O
falls O
to O
the O
west O
and O
a O
narrow O
path O
continues O
to O
the O
southeast O
. O


You O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
center O
of O
your O
laboratory O
, O
by O
the O
circular O
chest O
level O
table B-ART
that O
looks O
like O
the O
stump O
of O
a O
tree O
. O
On O
further O
inspection O
, O
however O
, O
the O
table B-ART
reveals O
that O
it O
is O
comprised O
of O
finely O
corrugated O
steel O
painted O
and O
shaped O
to O
mimic O
natural O
wood O
. O
The O
table B-ART
sprouts O
upwards O
like O
a O
mushroom O
, O
with O
an O
oak O
vat B-ART
crouching O
beneath O
its O
eaves O
and O
a O
ceramic O
black O
cover B-ART
, O
that O
at O
one O
time O
slid O
back O
to O
allow O
access O
to O
the O
hollow O
core O

Your O
glassware B-ART
spans O
the O
surface B-ART
, O
and O
a O
steel O
band B-ART
just O
below B-ART
the O
surface B-ART
provides O
hooks B-ART
for O
tools O

Suspended O
from O
the O
ceiling B-ART
horizontally O
in O
the O
center O
of O
a O
rusty O
chain B-ART
, O
a O
low O
oil O

provides O
a O
bright O
yellow O
gold O
light B-ART

The O
shallow O
cave O
leads O
out O
to O
the O
northeast O
and O
a O
shelf B-ART
of I-ART
reagents I-ART
nestles O
against O
the O
wall B-ART

You O
look O
at O
the O
shelf B-ART
closer O
but O
nothing O
strikes O
you O
as O
noteworthy O
. O


You O
are O
by O
the O
bookshelf B-ART
which O
fills O
the O
wall B-ART

On O
the O

is O
a O
brass O

that O
sheds O
a O
yellow O
gold O
light B-ART
upon O
the O
