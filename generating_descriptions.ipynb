            "Sherlock Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson early one winter morning to rush to a murder scene at the Abbey Grange near Chislehurst, Kent. Sir Eustace Brackenstall has been killed, apparently by burglars. Inspector Stanley Hopkins believes that it was the infamous Randall gang who have committed several other burglaries in the neighborhood.At Abbey Grange, Lady Brackenstall tells Holmes that her marriage was not happy; Sir Eustace was a violent, abusive drunkard. She then tells that about 11 oclock, in the dining room, she encountered an elderly man coming in the French window, followed by two younger men. The older man struck her in the face, knocking her out. When she came to, she was gagged and tied to an oaken chair with the bellrope, which they had torn down. Sir Eustace came into the room and rushed at the intruders, one of whom struck and killed him with a poker. Lady Brackenstall fainted again for a minute or two. She saw the intruders drinking wine from a bottle taken from the sideboard. Then they left, taking some silver plate.Sir Eustaces corpse is still lying at the murder scene. Hopkins tells Holmes some unsavoury things about Sir Eustace: that he poured petroleum over his wifes dog and set it alight, and once threw a decanter at her maid Theresa. Theresa corroborates Lady Brackenstalls account of Sir Eustace being an abusive alcoholic.Examining the bellrope, Holmes notes that if it was tugged hard enough to tear it down, the bell would have rung in the kitchen, and asks why nobody heard it. Hopkins answers that it was late, and the kitchen is at the back of the house, where none of the servants would have heard. This suggests that the burglars must have known this, indicating a link between them and one of the servants. Oddly, the thieves stole only a few items of silver plate from the dining room. The half-empty wine bottle and glasses interest Holmes - the cork had been drawn with the corkscrew of a \"multiplex knife\", not the long corkscrew in the drawer, and one of the glasses has beeswing dregs in it, but the others have none.Annoyed at being called to investigate a case that apparently has a ready-made solution, Holmes decides to catch the train back to London. However, after having mulled things over during the journey, Holmes thinks that Lady Brackenstalls story has too many holes in it and that probably she and Theresa have lied deliberately, staging a false crime scene. Upon returning to the Abbey Grange, Holmes, after examining again the supposed crime scene, reaches this conclusion: the killer cut the bellrope with a knife, and frayed the loose end to make it look broken. Holmes confronts Lady Brackenstall and Theresa, telling them he knows they are lying and demanding the truth, but they stand by their story. On the way out, Holmes notices a hole in the ice on the pond, and writes a note for Hopkins.Holmes searches for the killer: almost certainly a sailor (indicated by the knots and the active physique) who was previously acquainted with Lady Brackenstall, and whom she and Theresa would protect. Lady Brackenstall traveled by the ocean liner Rock of Gibraltar of the Adelaide-Southampton Line, which is now halfway to Australia. However, the ships first officer, Jack Crocker, who has been promoted to captain, has remained in England and in two days will take command of the companys new ship, Bass Rock. Holmes takes a cab to Scotland Yard but does not go in. He tells Watson he is reluctant to name the criminal to the police until he knows more.That evening, Hopkins calls at 221B Baker Street, with two items of news:As suggested in Holmes note, the stolen silver was found at the bottom of the pond. Holmes suggests that the theft was a blind—a deliberate false clue. However, Hopkins rationalises that the pond was chosen as a temporary hiding place.The Randall gang was arrested in New York that morning, so they couldnt have committed a murder in Kent the previous night.Later that evening, Captain Crocker comes to Baker Street, summoned by a telegram from Holmes. Holmes demands a full account of what happened at the Abbey Grange, warning Crocker that Holmes will summon the police if he lies or conceals anything.Crocker met a woman named Mary (Lady Brackenstall) on the voyage from Australia. He fell in love with her, but not she with him. Then he happened to meet Theresa, who told him of Sir Eustaces abusive behaviour. He met secretly with Mary at the house; the last time on the previous night. They were in the dining room when Sir Eustace burst in, insulted Mary, and struck her with a cudgel. He then attacked Crocker, who killed him with the poker in self-defence. Crocker adds that he has no regret whatever. To avoid the scandal that could ensue, Crocker and Theresa concocted the cover story of burglars caught in the act. He cut down the bellrope exactly as Holmes deduced; he opened the wine bottle with his pocket knifes corkscrew; he took some silver plate and dropped it in the pond.Holmes tells Crocker that the police dont yet know the truth, and that he will wait 24 hours before revealing it, allowing Crocker to get away. Crocker indignantly refuses the offer, insisting that he will only agree to any version of the case that will leave Mary out of it. But Holmes was only testing Crocker, and is impressed by his loyalty to Mary. He has given Hopkins \"an excellent hint\" and doesnt feel he must do more. He designates Watson as the \"jury\", and asks him to \"render a verdict.\" Watson declares Crocker \"not guilty.\" Holmes tells Crocker he will keep silent unless someone else is charged, and that he may come back to Mary in a year.\n"

Now, we learned that the watery snakes took the place of the kings watery boat, which was supposed to be able to catch them and the sea snakes came with them.  They tried to drown him, and when they did, he turned white, and the sea snake chased him until he turned white again; he then turned and chased them as if he were a man; he turned himself into a donkey, became a king, and returned with some gold and a horse.  After about nine months we met another watery boat and the kings horse, and our boat got rid of them faster than we could travel and had them stay with us, so we let them go when they came, and that was where we went.  Finally, we returned and tried to make the kings horse but he kept fighting with it from the boat.  We set out with the donkey, the king horse, and the horse that could stop him.  We went on.\n",

She comes back a year later, finds a coat and decides to go with her father, who comes to the house, and she says she will go with her father, since she is a princess, and if she puts on a suit that gives out their lights, it will be the finest dress she has ever seen.  He goes in with the suit for her, and she goes back with the dress and puts on a new suit with a black dress and a white neck.  When he goes to give her a bath with a new robe, she says she will not go with his, but he must tell her what is wrong with him, to him, and put him into a tub with her mother.  Then he goes out with the new dress, and she says he must, and then he goes with the same dress, and she says he must, and he must bring her back for his bath with her mother.  When he comes back, the princess has an old man bring her back to the castle and put her clothes all round her up.  She goes out after that.  In the castle, she hears a voice saying she must bring the boy to the room with her mother, and with a cloth on her breast she gets it.  The boy is put inside the tub, and inside it she opens a cabinet and sees a knife, which is used to slit open her gown.  She opens herself out to an ogress and gives him the knife before he is thrown overboard and sent home, but the ogress sees the knife and tells her to take it to her father who will punish his wife if she says the knife was the knife.  She does, and he puts her in a barrel with the ogresss cloth and a sword on the floor and tosses her off.  The ogress finds him and kills him, but gives him the cloth and the sword, and she goes back to his room, and gives him the knife before he is thrown overboard and sent home, but the ogress sees the cloth and tells her to take it to her father.  She does, and he puts her in a barrel with the ogresss cloth and the sword of three dragons and a prince.  When he is tossed away, the ogress finds him and kills him, but gives him the cloth and the sword, and she goes back to his room again.The ogress finds him and kills him, but gives him the cloth and the sword, and she goes back with the leather armor her father set up, and she put on a pair of silk shirts.  When he went to war, as a soldier fought for Spain, it was his custom to wear the most beautiful garments.  The ogress told her how she needed to put on the shirts again.  Her father told her it was fine, and she let the shirt come off, and he took her home for his own supper, and then the shirts left in bed.The next day, the prince had to fight for Spain again.  She explained it to him, and was sure his father killed the soldier and made her a bride.  She had a maid and a cook bring her home, but the servants killed her.  They went back with the clothing, and that night the prince sent her to the castle, asking for a bride with him, and gave it.  At the castle, the maid found her and warned her to have no talk.  The princes children showed her the bridal gown, and she had no quarrel about it, but the maid kept trying to make a quarrel while she was gone.  Finally she tried to get her revenge, but it was not her fault, because when her mother told her she had a maid, and the cook was at the wedding, the cook was killed by the maid.

His second year, with a dozen horses, and he lost only one head, but he agreed to let them take care of it.One day as they were making breakfast, the youngest asked for two heads, but the oldest agreed. They decided to have their head chopped off and put it back together. The youngest told her father about the incident and she told him about a wise man she met there.The youngest and her father returned to the church, and Mr. Silver found his old horse. He told his father it had lost its horns, so it brought them back. He gave his horse back. It told him that it had been stolen and sent him to look on as it remembered. The next day, it had returned with a hundred heads but the youngest agreed to trade them for her brother to make a loaf of bread with them.There, she had put on her headdress, she found that her brothers had put the horse on top of the skin, and that it had stolen one head. They set out and found a place to bury the missing horse. In the summer that followed, Mr. Silver told her story and the youngest was pleased with it.\n",

            "It is said that there are two princess who were born in a castle in the middle of land. The first princess is born and her mother is sad. The second princess is born and her mother is happy. In the morning, she wants her to marry; she wishes for an apple, a glass of wine, a cake, and a fine dinner. In vain and sad, she tells her sisters. The oldest sister asks for her to be the one to marry the second princess.The sisters go into the castle, meet the apple, the cake, and the fine dinner and decide to go home. Their sister asks the princess to be the one to leave. She gives her a ring and a golden ring. Next day, she wants to go out, but the sister tells her to wait the princess is nowhere. She asks to be taken to a forest; her sisters go down into the woods to be taken down, but the eldest princess is not there, because the younger sisters must die. Then she asks to go into the forest. She sits and waits. When the three sisters return, all die, the youngest princess is taken to the woods and killed. When the youngest daughters daughter asks to be taken to this place, she is given the ring.The eldest daughter sees what a horrible, terrible fate has beenfallen her sisters. She begs to be taken to her sisters graves. When the older sisters ask, they do as they are told, and the youngest sister is given the golden ring. She is the first to die of grief, and she is taken to the burial mound. The youngest sister is buried in gratitude and the grave is filled with caskets by day.In the Grimm version, there were three brothers who bore to death the younger sisters brothers. The eldest brother had an army and went on to the kings daughter. He told the king that if she would marry one of the youngest sisters, he would give her a pair of plaits and a pair of spindles. He was to build a palace for one of the sisters, that was to marry the youngest sister.When she was ten, the king went away to war. He told the kings sister; the king told her this and to tell her the same, and the queen gave her a feather.Then her sisters went off and told her what they would be; the sister had her put on a stool and told her to sit on it and sing to herself for an hour.Then the queen went to the chamber and asked her what she would find there. The queen told her what to make of a feather. So she put it somewhere where a princess would put a shell, but it was impossible, for she had a feather and it was there. Then the princess went to eat some meat. She lay on her back for three hours. She sat on the stool, saying that once it was done, the kings sister would marry her. The queen came to her, and she said that this must be the kingdom she loved, and should not have married her. She said that she might have a good meal with her sisters, so the queen put on the shell for them, and they talked. She asked for the first one, and it was ready. She said, they must set fire to the kitchen, and then not know where to find her.The queen went to get the feathers, and by chance, the second sister were asleep. She asked to sit down, and the queens sister said that if the king would like to hear the bird and the flight, then he was to marry her.\n",

            ".The following day, the prince and his mother go hunting in a cave for a room in the house. The queen arrives and gives the king a poisoned rice ball, but the man who has been searching for her for many nights keeps eating it. The prince gets hungry, and falls asleep. It turns out that this man is the king of the snakes. An old woman comes by the same cave, and gives the prince a ring that will turn back the man who ate the poisoned rice ball back to life. The prince awakens to find a woman in his fathers tent.  The woman asks her father to take him to her. When the prince tells her that his mother will stay for a year and a day to await the return of his beloved, she agrees to stay the same. One night, the prince asks his mother for a little star to go with him to his fathers tent. The woman, who has never seen the sun and can never get the sun to shine on her, is afraid to go to the prince, but offers her a tiny piece of her golden birthright for him to turn back the little star. The prince turns his eyes back and finds her golden birthright, but his eyes hide the sun. Finally, as a gift from his mother, the prince summons three birds with golden feathers and a golden-clawed dog. The man who ate the poisoned rice ball turns back the star on his mother and becomes a beautiful woman.At last, the prince and his mother return to their fathers home. The prince marries a woman from his fathers extended family and moves to the same place, but the prince takes care of the little bird. For many years, he has a wife and daughter, but each time a bird comes for a dinner, he is unable to find her or the tiny bird. Eventually the prince summons a whole flock of birds in succession to go to his father and mother for a birthday dinner. One day, the prince brings them to get a dinner plate, but no bird comes for the same price. Eventually the son of the prince takes the bird and turns it into a golden queen. Every night he goes to sleep on the edge of his bed, but he sees nothing but a beautiful white bird sit on the edge of his bed. He turns the bird into a prince and marries the queen. Her father is rich.The queen begins to eat the prince, but no sooner does he awake than she has a dish thrown into the pot. He swallows it and realizes nothing is being eaten, but he still holds onto her. She then tells the prince she will return to him if he makes him dinner that night. He makes her dinner and is overcome with hunger when she tells him she will not eat with him. In the night, the queen tells the prince to go home. The prince runs after her but sees nothing left. He throws a golden dinner plate at her. The prince awakens and notices the dish is missing. He takes a bite and notices her golden gown is missing its golden crown. He tosses the dishes to reveal the princes skin and finds the kings body underneath the bed. The prince goes to get it, but his companions are still awake. When he sees the prince, he throws the body into boiling coals for he can smell them. The prince is taken by the prince who is eating his daughter while he is sleeping. The prince reveals the princes body as his own and is given a chest filled with treasure. An eagle takes the chest and brings it back home to her parents. The eagle asks the prince to return to his father. In his new life, the prince becomes a king, but still can not find his way. He decides to set out in search, and sees a vision in the night: a beautiful woman looking up from a flower and a rose. The prince tells the woman there is nothing he can do for him but to look for her, and finally, he tells the woman he will marry her. The next morning, his father hears the little bird say, \"May I have you a little rose on one side of the ear and a little fire in the other?\" He is to turn back and let the fire cool him down. By that time, the prince has had the golden dress he found in the chest, and he has taken her to his realm to be his son. But she still cannot find him. The eagle takes the prince and marries him to another prince, his sister, after their wedding.\n",

            " to a far land and back.The king of the neighbouring countries sends his son to the same land and at the same time sends another son to the same land. One night he sees a girl playing dead and casts the last living thought in his head. He awakes an eagle and buries the last thought under a poppy. After his father and uncle have left, their wives give him a lump of gold and give him a chance at finding the golden pomegranate.He heads back to his fathers house and searches the land looking for his parents. He drops the silver treasure under the carpet and then leaves, telling his wife to return immediately to help him. She happens to be the daughter of the ruler of the poppy, and he knows about her as he says to ask his three daughters to fetch him a place to stay in case the eagle tried to seize him.The son stays with his father as he never expected to see such an eagle, but on the way back he kills two in succession and then returns and he claims to have killed seven with his last shot. The son tries to play but his wife stops him; he says the eagle got in his house. He then demands a carriage from him by a rider over a river. The brother says he can take it but the sister says he can demand a coach-and-a-half from him. The brother agrees to accept this condition and he leaves, taking his younger son with him.The brother sends his eldest brother for a coach with silver and silver and a black horse with gold and takes the golden horse. He sets three times the king to his castle, then his castle; his brother bids him open the door, as a warning, but he does not. The next two times, he attempts to steal the horse. The third time, the boy attacks and fends off his brothers.He takes the gold and the horse with silver and goes home and finishes the golden horse. He does not return to his mother, but her sister has warned her there is danger and brought her home. She has a golden key and has a golden horse. She has a golden ring that her father cannot retrieve and has him dress as a black horse in a golden saddle. With the black horses return, she has all the gold and silver and sends the king to invite all the kings daughters. Then she has the daughter-in-law prepare for wedding to the kings brothers. She has a ring in front of her, but the king has not opened the door. The prince, the queen and their sons walk on and a golden eagle lands. The prince makes a great speech, proclaiming that there will be no use in his presence because his brothers and his sisters will become kings in like manner. Another tale tells that the prince tried to lure the youth into a tower and the eagle flew off. The third tale tells of a boy who would have gone the same way had his brothers brought him before him, dressed in fine clothing but his own brothers tried. That prince and the queens daughter were married brings an ironic twist. The prince married his son and would not have married a peasant if they had known. It is said that the prince had the young queen wait until the king was asleep, but that is not true, except that his three consort had already married his niece to someone else. The prince and his sisters have no children of their own. One day, in order to give his sons health, the queen goes to the castle and asks each of the princes sons if they are their own sons. The prince answers they are his own sons, which is true, but the queen had hoped for a happy marriage and now she lies.The queen, her daughter and her daughter went to see the sons. They had no children, but they found a great bed and it was filled with golden fruit. The queen gave them a gold ring and a golden feather and vowed never to marry again.\n",

The king came and asked where he had gotten his royal coat, if he was well, if he was in good physical condition, and to whom he should give anything.  The prince, in the first degree, could not give anything without taking a bath, and he was a natural fit when a prince. On the other hand, if he were ill, he could have any coat he wanted on him, but he was a strange thing to take ill with one coat.  One day, he took out the golden feather and a golden flask of water, then told his wife to take them.  The king sent to his wife, and as soon as the princess lay down on her throne to await him, she put her ring and it on her ring.  They flew to the king and told him they had come to save her.  When he gave their princess the ring, the princess took it and fell in love with the prince.  The princess set her servants to tend the horses, but no one could recover them.\n",

            " corn as \"Apostle Scholastica\" was born.  He lived in a hut made of corn.  When bread was grown, he cut up the kernels and sprinkled them on the kernels.  He named the man  \"Scholastica\" to signal he was grown up.  The king ordered him to be brought before him, and after eating two sweet dogs, ate one as well, but he slept.  So on the way, he was stopped by a stranger who asked whether he had come to receive that which he had promised.  He supposed so.  He told his story, and that he had come to fear that old age, from eating his two dogs, would kill him.  The stranger said he hadnt harmed a dog in ages, but rather had eaten bones.  He brought him a skull, an egg, and a bellows shovel, and gave them to the king.  The king went to deliver the body, and the stranger found his wife by the window.  He took the body, buried it, and took custody of his dead wife.  The king said that if something had been done to her, that person would have died, and so put her on her death warrant.The king said he would execute her if he had the skull, and her husband brought her to the palace.  When the queen was delivered of her children, the stranger carried her off to a palace in the woods.  There he met three men, each of whom spoke in different tongues, of what had happened, and when the third spoke ill of her, he confessed it was his dead wife.The king came to view this as his dead wife was brought before him, and many pretended to visit her. They took her brothers and sisters and presented them to the king; then he demanded their leave, which gave them room to exist if they so desired.  So the stranger went, disguised as a monk, and showed them to the king.  His wife came.  Seeing her with her brothers, he asked if he could kill them.  The stranger said he could not kill her when he brought her brothers.  They sent her to her brothers.  Her brothers told her that they would harm her only if she brought them to the castle.  One day, a prince came to her castle to show his love to her; when she showed him her dead sons and the crypts where their bodies stood, he said that would be enough.  He went to dig them up, but seeing the dead bodies along the way, persuaded her brother to take a sword to defend himself.  He drew the snuff-box with the heads of the snuff-boxes left over from the fight with her older brothers, and threw it at her brothers; then he wounded them both with the box.  The older brothers had to retreat, and her sister made them stop there.  Then she found the boxers alive and talking with some stranger.  She pulled out the boxers bodies and buried them in her garden.  Her brother sent a man to retrieve them, and then sent back the bodies but before they could pile on the ground, the stranger threatened that she and the brother had become murderers if not for her brother.Then she brought the snail snail king to his castle.  After three days in the castle, she persuaded him to allow her to visit the dead bodies.  Her brother threatened to hang her if she did not bring him a snail.  The king went back to her sister, only this time, she persuaded him to put a sack of rotten meat on the snail so that the king could eat it.  The king found the snail without the meat.  Her sister came back with a second group.  The king asked if the third snail had the meat and it had not eaten any.  She said it was fine.  Then she killed it, using the snails flesh.Her sister went to the kings room and gave him the snail, but with no meat or no meat and no meat and no meat.\n",

            "Cervantes tells the story of Ennig, Aragón, and the two friends who were created by God to act as soldiers on the plains in the first book. The protagonists were soldiers on the plains who fell in love at first sight with each other, but were deceived by the giant at the hands of Truvera, Aglantines, and García. Ennig, Aragón, and the two friends who were formed from his memory of an old scarab in a pots basket are now free to go on. The story closes with the capture of the city of Nueva Tijuca by Cervantes, under the pretence that it was a hidden fortress, guarded by a thousand invisible warriors, and guarded by a thousand soldiers. The story was originally set to be set in the city during the First Part of the Roque Period and has now been extended with additions by Guerrino and Castile.Other\n",

He had been enchanted by a fairy whose light shone against the darkness, and knew well the manner in which a peasant wishing to free his slave could, by falling from the horse into a stream in the forest, free his slave—then himself, from his pastime for three months; and he could do it, and so, to secure his release, he did it.  The prince, returning to his own land in the north, was rude and feeble-minded, so the peasant begged the help of the peasant who was calling himself Red Fern, a peasant name for a fish.  The peasant offered him all sorts of refreshments, such as beer and wine, but the peasant always had to go to the field to fill his fields, and did not appear in the sunlight. Now the peasant was inclined toward hard work, which impressed him, and he continued his journey with more exertion. At once, a pigeon asked him to take it into it what happened to the Red Fern and, thinking it was a bad omen, ate the bird.  He returned to the field, and the pigeon caught a branch, and the peasant cut down the tree and planted his wheat.  The bird came flying out, and the peasant jumped into his cart.  This revealed his wife and his servant who all ran away, leaving the peasant with a piece of fruit and a meal.The servant chased after the servant-feudal: the peasant who ate the fruit, and the servant who immediately caught the fruit. After the servant-feudal, the peasant with the pigeon, also took, and the peasant grew rich, marrying Red Fern.\n",

            "A rich man had a beautiful wife and a beautiful son who was named Dongguk-seok.  At the time of his death, the father died and his children were not able to go on living.  The mother died alone and the stepmother was left alone with her child.  An old woman met her husband Dongrun-young who told her to bring his handkerchief to him.  When this would not work, many young men came trying to get their hands on it.  Many did, but only a few succeeded.  The rest followed and failed and were eventually replaced by other unsuccessful attempts.  Then an old woman came to the gate of the mansion and told everyone to open the door, but only one succeeded.  The old woman was angry that her only servant had tried to open the door, as she and her servant had failed so miserably.  A young man tried but was unable to enter.  He took a piece of bread, ate it, and soon was taken out.  The young man found himself in a dark hall, not far from the castle where his wife and child were staying.  She offered to let him in and let him tell her everything she needed to know.  First she put on her finery and told him the tale of a woman who always carried water in a bokang (sea-chair).  The finery was that her husband could not reach the bottom.  A dead sea-bird cried out for help and brought back the water.  The next day, another body washed ashore, this one on her final resting place.  This time, the woman was able to identify the person swimming in the spring by the finery.  The next night, she presented herself to Dongguk-seok who, when he saw her, asked her to marry him.  Dongguk-seok died, while his son succeeded him, and his stepmother died of grief the next morning.  The stepmother set out to find her husband, but she found many obstacles which tried to hinder her.  Dongguk-seok first tried a bokan tree, which, with its seven branches and nine tubs of milk, was made by a poor man.  She found a rich man there, and while he was there, she took off her finery.  The rich man brought her to the bottom of the sea, where she was overcome by a strange urge:  to her delight.  She ordered the bread to be sacrificed, and, when it was, she tossed it overboard.  The man found his finery, whereupon he married the young man.One day, while Dongguk-seok was going on a journey, the whole court rowed by, and found a woman there.  Dongguk-seoks finery was proved true.  The king wooed this woman, and was about to marry her when a bird cried out for water; a woman in a boat, crying out for gold, got it; the woman in the boat cried out for two golden apples, a golden reel, and protection from the cold.  The woman in the boat asked her if she had ever regretted it.  She confessed to her lover and was executed.  The\n",

            "As an orphan with a fondness for pigs, Little Two Face, also known as Muzie One or Little Two Face 2, had a pig heart that she stole when she was an infant. Due to this, she was placed in the care of the most deprived in the form of a rats nest, with the care of a nanny that earned her respect and affection. When she was old enough to know right from wrong, Little Two Face was able to come up with a plan to rid the hall of the rats.Following this, her parents are invited many times over the ocean to wrestle for glory (against powerful competitors, of course). They fail several times before the mat is thrown and the last time in the form of rope and rope are used on the rats nest. When the mat is finally lowered and the matches are kept on the seashore, the nurses (Dr. Zoomzeman) who treat the rats are paid a fortune because of the gold that has been left behind.Some time later, the king decides to the tournament as he is set to lose 25 to 30 points and the queen is set to lose 25 to 30. On the way home, Little Two Face, who is only under three scratches on her human face, tries to help the woman but is rebuffed by the queen. As she runs out of steam, Little Two Face takes a hammer and other implements and runs out to the forest. Back home, Muzie One or 2, the rats mother, becomes angry and attacks the woman, frightening her enough to become pregnant.Despite the babies success, the queen is unable to keep up with Little Two Face and cannot keep up with her. Unbeknownst to the rats mother, Muzie One is also pregnant and is pushed out of the house as the rats mother attempts to destroy her life support by cooking her (with the help of the rats mother). On her way back to her home, Little Two Face is visited by Muzie Two, who is also missing her own baby boy, which she can only assume is a nurse/surgeon/whatever. Little Two Face visits Muzie One and shes overcome with sorrow and pity her, and tells her that she wont be able to support a son with her heart in her body and heart out of reach. Muzie Two, however, tries to look troubled by her loss and sympathizes with Little Two Face as she takes revenge on the rats mother. Muzie One returns to the house and reports back to the queen and the nurse, who figure out where Muzie Two is.The queen and nurse set out to find and rid the hall of the rats. While they find the house of the rats, Little Two Face meets up with her mother along the way. The mother tells Little Two Face that she is her sister and that she will live with her in the palace instead of having her mother and baby moved to the other house.The queen moves the boys palace into the new house and takes the rats away from Little Two Face, who leaves the house to do her work. Muzie Two becomes depressed and lonely and the housework causes her to lose her eyesight. Muzie Two soon comes across the rats nest and begins to cry during the day. When she visits the nest, she hears voices telling her what to do, and one says:\"Tell them that my eye is failing,I need another eye for my left eye to see something;Tell them that my foot is failing,I need a foot for my leg to walk;Tell them that my back is failing,I need a foot for my face to round and glitter like gold;Tell them that my head is failing,I need something better,a beautiful voice,a wise mans voice,and a little black bird somewhere in the air.\"At night Little Two Face, who has lost her eyesight, visits the nest again to listen to the voices. Finally, she hears voices saying:\"Tell them that my foot is failing,I need another foot for my right foot to round and glitter like gold;Tell them that my head is failing,I need a little voice,a little black bird somewhere in the air,\"As the four servants leave the house, Little Two Face, with the help of the black bird, wanders around the palace, finding the rats nests and seeing the voices. When she goes outside to look for her beloved mother, the nurse hears voices saying:\"Tell them that my eye is failing,I need another eye for my right eye to see something;Tell them that my foot is failing,I need a foot for my left foot to round and glitter like gold;Tell them that my head is failing,I need a little voice,a little black bird somewhere in\n",

            "The story centers on a butcher and his wife, who have been left without a son either since the boy was born or since the day of its establishment in the mid-18th century. One day, the butcher announces he will not be going forward with a son-in-law whom he does not recognize. His wife suspects he is lying and consults with a midwife, but she warns her husband to speak with his name and that of his wife, if he intends to deceive the butcher. They refuse his offer and disobey our command to command. He tells his wife they will not allow him to mix wheat and barley and threaten them until they have food for both of them. The butcher then threatens to shoot an arrow into the ground if they continue to defy us.The butcher and his wife fear for their son, who will seek them from them. He walks along the road until he sees a flock of sheep. He takes them home and eats one at a time. One day, he is about to throw some into the stream when he is about to be slaughtered. The butcher hides his face in his butcher block as he fears retribution for the slaughter. He tells his wife he will not do such a thing and she runs away into the forest.At the butcher, his son begins to play in the forest. One day, he decides to visit his father who gives him a magical earthen vessel to reside in. The butcher asks him if he knows of a way to make a living from the magical vessel. The butcher tells him about a magical chant that the prince can chant to accomplish his aims. To his surprise, the prince chants the magical chant and earns a living from the vessel. The butcher sells the earthen vessel to the king, who puts the prince in the boat and takes his son to sell him in the marketplace.Later in his journey, the butcher tells the prince that his son-in-law is in the middle of selling the earthen vessel in the marketplace. On his way to the vessel, the butcher deposits the prince in the boat and he is engulfed in the flames. As the prince falls to the ground, he asks his wife to \"wake up [him]\". The wife begins to awaken and asks the butcher if he knows a way to put an end to his suffering. The butcher does not know and he curses the prince to eat him in his sleep. The wife resurrects him and restores the earthen vessel to life.The butcher and his son go to avenge themselves on and go to avenge themselves against the prince. The butcher goes to the middle of the forest and searches for his brother in order to slaughter them. While searching, the brothers animal husband tries to tranquilize him by taunting him into staying hidden. The butcher and his son discover that the animal husband and his son, also called the \"devotee\", are actually the princes devoted cowives who are torturing their livestock. The butcher prepares to kill the animals but the servants cast a spell on themselves and retreats back into the hollow of their hollow. When they do not respond to the summon, the servants release the princes servants and go back to their palatial home. The butcher and his son return to the butcher with the earthen vessel and the prince, who they see are two very young and well-dressed men dancing in the meadows with a royal wedding feast ahead of them. The butcher summons his two other brothers-in-law who come to live next to the butcher and his wife who lives next to the butcher and his wife. The butcher summons his sister-in-law who live next to the butcher and his wife who lives next to his wife. The sister-in-law, after seeing the princes animal husband and treating him badly, decide to punish the prince by killing the animal husband. However, they do not know the morality of this act. After the butcher and his brother-in-law live next to the butcher and treat him badly, the butcher and his wife decide to leave the prince and go to another kingdom to live better lives. After spending several years traveling and travelling, the butcher and his wife eventually stop by a remote location to start a new life together again. They decide to stay the course and go to another country to live in another country without their animals. They decide to go to another country again and return to their animals. In order to test their new life together they decide to set a wild horse race in another country. The butcher, his brothers-in-law and a third butcher arrive in the neighbouring country and slaughter the animals there. During the horses first race the butcher tells the animals to hurry and tells the animals to go where they saw them coming and chase the animal as best they can. The animals chase the butcher quickly though the bran and when the animal tries to catch him stop him.

            " him the prince when he came to marry his daughter. The king was very happy when the royal children were born, and the children came to his mind when he first heard the word \"teenager\" growled, which surprised him. He set no expectations for himself thereafter, but his desire to learn more made him want to learn and succeed, and his perseverance made him want to learn.At first, the princes parents did not believe in their son-in-law. At the wedding, the kings daughter, Beowulf, demanded that her husband learn how to cast his spells (the two do not agree on how to perform the spells, but she explains). At the wedding, her father, afraid that her daughters ridicule, offered to teach his son to cast spells. Beowulf did not want to, and instead ordered his guests to sit with him in the hall (or on spears), telling him to let his guard down and not to move about until they saw someone with the ability to speak, move, and do all three. Beowulf later died of grief, grief, and a loss of appetite.\n",

            "A king had a beautiful wife and a rich castle. He wished for a son. His queen thought she had a son who would surpass all other princesses and would surpass the greatest of all, the seven-headed Unicorn.  Her fairy godmother, the red-haired Hruntenmark, had her victim crush watch the child, and this convinced her that the cruel queen was insane.  The princess was shocked to find her a handsome young man, and when Hruntenmark came begging in the dark at her wifes door, she put her magical blue cloak on and ran away . Finally, she told Hrothgar and Furibon was born, and they went looking for the child.Hruntenmark eventually persuaded Furibon, and then his mother, to send him to Fairyland with him. Furibons mother had been enchanted by a folklore hero, and one day lost the belt. Her husband, a fisherman, revealed this, and Hrothgar, who believed in ghosts, showed up and replaced the belt for a night in his cell. Furibon could not stay awake at night, and in order to ensure he would not die, dressed up their child like a dragon and flew off. However, one by one, the fairy gods appeared, and they talked. Finally, the child came, and they kept talking about his powers. One day, he became immortal. He told them he wanted to be married. The fairy deities told him he could marry anyone and could do nothing to make them immortal, so he left for the forest.He wandered until he came to a castle, where he heard a dog barking.  It proved that the dog was the fairy deity himself, taking great pains to show him the marvelous world he had come to visit.Hearing that the castle was inhabited by a raven, he prepared to show the fairy godmother his guests his treasures.  However, he remained in the castle a long time, and on seeing the lady moving out of doors just then to make its way through the doors, he was able to scare the raven off. He then demanded a chamber with the portrait of his future wife, which the goddess knew was there the only clue he had.  The lady left just then, and Hrothgar would not come through it.  The fairy godmother went herself out and told the youth that he would assume the form of a horse and kill her instantly.  He went to the castle where the lady was, and while showing the portrait to the still standing lady, put one leg on the bed, and pulled down the other, to show the red-hot iron belt.  She screamed.  Not wanting to let the youth follow her, the fairy godmother wrapped herself behind the back of the bed and led the youth into the chamber, so he would not be consumed by fire.  The youth followed the fairy godmother, and during the night put out the fire in the chamber.When he woke, an old fairy maiden stood beside him.  She pleaded with him, not knowing what to do.  When he told her everything, the old fairy maiden turned him into a bird, and turned him into a wolf, and made him free for the night.  Then she made him welcome.  He came to eat at a table and asked at a straw fountain where the supper was.  He gave a way when an ant saw him, and she turned him into a goose.  Then it flew off and flew back to the fairy godmother.  She warned him to never let the fairy godmother touch him, lest he would lose his sight.  He did and found a beautiful princess all by her turn.  He fell down hard when he saw her, and her glove turned to iron.  He tried to use the iron on the woman until she saw it, and used the iron on the princess, and then the woman\n",

            "Three sisters were tending cows when a king and his company went by. The oldest pointed at the king and said she would marry him or no one; the second pointed at the first, and the king said she would marry him or no one. When the brother pointed her in the ribs, the first lumped her bones into one lump. Then she was turned into a lump of vomit, which made it difficult for the king to recognize her. He then had to go to the sister for help. The woman in the middle lumped into a lump of vomit, and then the first meal helped the sister stop lumping in her laps; the woman in the last lump stopped it and helped the sister to get away. The king became ill with longing and longing, and the brother took his revenge.The sister was left alone in the castle and without a husband. The king went to visit her, but his councilors warned him not to let her alone because she was too ugly to afford a husband. He found that he was right and married her. One day a beggar woman helped the beggar woman, and then the woman offered to give her some herbs in exchange for her help. The woman in the last disguise also sold her some herbs. The king saw his wife and ended up rejecting her. In the end, the woman changed her into a little old woman, and her husband came to visit again.The woman changed her into a flower-bed, and her husband into a shepherd. The shepherd gave her a pair of scissors, one to pry the dirt from his nose, and warned her not to use them against the garden. He caught a grey bird, and when he was done, she used the scissors to separate the dirt and ashes. The shepherd offered to give her shelter for the night, and the king agreed.At dawn, the woman turned into a rosebush, and her husband into a shepherd with a shepherd-like face. The bride insisted on going on the sheeps path, but the shepherd told her that he was afraid of walking into the garden. He went down to the town to make arrangements. The girl came upon a little shepherd girl, who asked her to go down to the garden, and to wish her well, to ask no one came. She went, wishing herself magnanimous and just, and walked through the garden, stroking the sheep as it came its nudge. The little shepherd girl encouraged it to go on, and the sheep concluded that she was just as well as the others when it came to thoughts of beauty and of desire.Then the girl put her beautiful hand to the shepherd girl and kissed him, and his mother said he was under a curse which would last for three nights, but the witch would put him to sleep for three nights, and his father would let him. The girl kept this from his mother, who would only let him dream one of the forbidden nights, because it was too much on his mind. His mother told him that she would stop him, and when he dreamed, her finger became a pillow member and he was lifted up into the air. He came to a cottage where there were mixed kinds and colors of birds. The shepherdess who had caught him wanted him for his kind and kind of bird. Her name was Udea, meaning \"beautiful.\" The man who brought him to her had ordered that he take his shift in the cottage as his master was a witch, who could make him lose his temper with just sound, as on sheep.She took him to her daughter in the cottage, who had no objections, but upped the insult with the saying of the cabbie, which sent the king tiring. The next day, the king had brought the kings daughter into the cottage. The woman had her make a robe out of feathers, lay it on the bed, and fastened it to her neck. The king brought her and fastened it to the carpets table, and the maidservant over his leg. The third day, the king held a ball in which he might pretend to charm people to it, and the girl stirred it up with an infusion of milk and sugar, and it went with him when he came to tie up the ball in the dirt.At last, the ball was put on the kings table; the king took it to his wife and had his son tie it in the dirt, whenever he heard something. The girl never used the ball again.One day, the king came looking for his wife. He took her shoes, that he might show her before he went to bed, and found only a table and a chair beside her; they were in the house. The king found them and brought him to tie the ball up and his daughter helped him again. The king said he never would have had the ball with such a girl, if she knew how to do it.The girl told him to\n",

            "A rich farmer died the third day after going to Heaven.  A stranger asked him what had happened, and he told of his wife not being there the third day, the stranger told him that Heaven lay next to prepare for a flood, and he should take the bread, and if he washed it in the lake, it would wash into the lake.  He was to fill three sacks and set them on the spot, and then return after them.  The second man asked him what had happened the day before, and he told him he was already at the gates.The stranger told him that the Lord had sent three dogs to check at the gate.  When he had filled his sacks, he sent the sacks home, and the first man also confirmed what the stranger had told him.  The second man asked to stay there and the third confirmed what he had told him.  Heaven was surrounded by three large chambers, which Sigurd was about to open by himself.  The stranger stopped him, told him one of the dogs was guarding it, and offered to take him to Hell as a guest.  Sigurd was willing, and at the end of the night, put his head in a cask at the gate.He entered the main hall, door locked, and unlocked only by a knock.  Sleeping under the freezing sun, he was greeted by three Cádiz; two giants, and a third knight.  Sigurd brought them food and rode the giant up to the castle, where he and the other knights found that the giant was dead, were filled with pride, and escaped with riches.  He made his way to the giants castle, and when the giants soldiers came to beg one day, he gave them silver and said if they fell into their hands, they would fill the prison and become his faithful servants.The servants and the prisoners of Hrothgar Then Sigurd and Heloise went back to the giants, and said that the three Cádizs should go to Hell as soon as they saw their king again.  The giant let them pass, and they got from him their golden and silver swords.  At the giants request, Heloise got two hundred gold pieces, while her husband got the smaller sword, which met no enemies. So they went to the Gate of Heavens Gate, and for the love of the king (the daughter of the king of Orlandes), Heloise went to her father who had soldiers awaiting for him.  The king despaired; the soldiers gave him their first sword, which was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, and he kept them safe by melting their heads.  Then Sigurd went to meet the Giant-Shining-Boy, who came to him by the Sign of the�αλειώσι δὴν это яв�я я40,000.  Sigurd thought he should go higher up in the tower, to break the giants skulls, but the giant held him there.  Then he asked the threatening prince if he would fight Sigurd, and the prince agreed.  Then they fought at the Giants Arms, and the giant defeated them all, encircled it, and locked the gates.When the giant Sigurd came after, on the sides of those who had fled, he cut off its heads.  But not before one giant remained, and one thousand men.  Then he gave the prince the sword that split the giants skulls, and Sigurd married Heloise and became king.\n",

One evening, he hears a wood-serpent threatening to run away, and drops the pike into the stream to do so. Hans is grateful as it makes the pike invisible to the pursuer. The wood-serpent disappears, and Hans finds a great black box in his house, which contains a history of all that has happened the night that has been told to him. He puts the box in a headlamp, alerts his wife to what is going on, and then goes inside the house to check on her. When Hans is in the house, the dog runs into Hans.

            " an enemy to the castle because of his wicked morals. When the emperor consented to the surrender in DArtagnan and the cardinal had already warned the king against it, then appeared in the castle and demanded the palace, saying he wanted the castle otherwise none could come to its aid.  Prezzemolina refused to leave.With the kings consent, he transformed the giant Sapia into a graceful flower and gave him a belt to carry. When the galley crew received the same finding, they had recovered the items but thought the prince dead, so they had the galley crew arrested and charged. Once again, the prince appeared but this time, a large troop marched up the hill, demanding the palace.The galley crew finally got the culprit down to earth. Arriving at the scene, they found the garden of the giants god Odysseus full of animals and treasures, but no one knew where the treasures were or even knew they were actually the giants deers. The man went to look in the garden, and a snake sprung out of it. The man hunted the garden and came across the snake with the horse and dog in the valley.  The man took the snake out, skin and hide falling from his mouth, and went back to look at the god.  The giant ordered him to do as the giant ordered, and he killed the animal with his club. The giant took pity on the little man and gave him the animal, instructing him to set it free and take the man to the gate.At the gate the giant brought back the maiden, taken captive and mistreated, she became the subject of conversation among the guards and an offer to be cooked alive made to the giant. Being rejected the giant was able to take whatever he wanted without harm, notwithstanding their protests. The witchs anger was ended when the giant resolved to kill the maiden, even if it meant killing his child, and to this day the giant still punishes her. The prince believes that she had in some way served him for many years and grown to love him despite his insanity. Unferthane and Ferraventine, the princes servants, visit to re-assured minds that they were still children once they came of the witch, now freed from the bonds of witch-dom and placed under the protection of the sovereign. The king learns of this and believes this to be the case with the maiden whose wanderer set made him welcome. Thus, Porthos and Ferras survivors are able to present their story to the sovereign, while the dying Porthos now spends a year in the castle with his family. The sovereign is sickened by the stories the troth has grown more serious each time. The time comes for the crown prince to make a public confession. The witchs husband finally confessed. The king assailed the witchs house one last time , and the second time he stopped by the witchs daughters window to wish them a happy birthday. Ferras witch wives finally caught up with him, he begged them not to kill him (which they did not want because he threatened the lives of their loved ones), revived them (after having been made to forget them) and gave him another hundred thousand thalers (which he then pocketed). They then had their daughters eat the thalers as they please and leave the castle to find the prince. Ferras and the prince go in search, but discovers two thieves trying to rob the inn. The prince kills the man and both return with the maiden.Ferraux agents discover the bodies of the prince and Ferras agents discover the treasure chest containing the prince and Ferras children. On their return home Ferraus servants tease and tease the prince for going to the thieves house in the first place. The prince admits to having killed his wife and now he has all the courage to admit he did not loved his wife, but claims he has spared the prince. Meanwhile, the agents discover that the prince had married the maiden they all thought he married. They now have to face the truth in court.\n",

            "A rich widow lived with her daughter and her stepdaughter. The widow favored her younger biological daughter, allowing her to become spoiled and idle while her older stepdaughter was left to do all the work. Every day, the stepdaughter would sit outside the cottage and spin beside the hot spring in the winter.One day, the stepdaughter noticed that the spindle she was making is missing a nut. She inquited her mother about it; but nobody knew the answer. The widow hated the mystery and refused to let the girl touch the spindle. Eventually, the stepdaughter pushed her into the well, and when the wicked widow came to fetch water, the girl did not even reach the well. The widow demanded to know the answer, and the girl confessed. The wicked widow died days later.Despite the fact that the girls physical appearance was spoiled, the widow became a princess and married the stepdaughter. The princess had her wash blood from her hands three times, so that she poured\n",

            " but is in fact a raven. Its master turns her into a goat and places her in a tiny bath. As the raven dries, the youth stretches his leg, which changes color to black, and the bird flies out. The youth puts its feathers in a pot and places it outside. She wanders about, and with her find a small house and when she opens it, a stove. She goes inside to let her wonder what the hell she is doing. The youth tells her that the cook has her take boiled eggs and rations in the dish. She goes back to the cook, who spins the eggs into bread loaves and serves them to her. She tells her parents she can no longer smoke after that, and they inquire about puffs of burning burning.The youth goes outside and, seeing the chickens having dropped dead, goes to the chickens, claiming to have herbs to cure them. The chickens respond by smelling hot and purifying, and when they touch the cinders surface, the rosewater turns into coca. The youth rubs his hands into cups, allowing the rosewater to drip into his hands. He then takes a hopper to carry the rosewater to his house. He returns home to find his house empty. He throws a bunch of birch logs into the yard, which in turn turn become a spring. He hoists the chickens from the tree and goes back to his house, claiming to have herbs in his garden. He picks them up, drinks some, and jumps in the basket.The chickens notice that he has become so hot, and lay an apricot tree to stop him. The chickens decide to take the chicken wing off, at which point the chicken bellows, causing the chickens to drop the branch. The chickens move their branch off, but still the tree grows and warns them that if they do not do it they will be burned.The next day, the chickens climb the tree, take the branch off, and stop at the bakery. They stop at the bakery again and notice the chicken yelled out, \"That tastes so good, turn me to stone!\". Again, the chickens follow the chicken, but this time the chicken cries out, \"That tastes so good, turn me to stone!\". As they begin to form shapes and instructions on how to be killed, the youth reaches into his bag and pulls out a bite of salt. He then walks out of the house, toward the trees, with the chickens still screaming in his wake.The second day, the chickens went to slaughter, meeting the chickens chirping \"What the hell was that?\". The chickens continue to chirmur \"Well, well, well, we come into it\". The chickens then ride off, leaving the dead chickens at the slaughterhouse.The chickens notice that the smell of salt makes them hungry, so they ask for some food and drink, and the chickens eat one of those. The youth takes a handful of almonds and returns to the house of the butcher. The butcher lets the chickens go, but orders the chickens to stay at the house of the butcher, because they are part of his order. Chicken \"Eat, Take This Way\" and \"Take the Road\" appear in the merchants inventory, and the chickens nod to the direction they are going when they say \"Eat, Take This Way\". The butcher shifts the directions they are going, allowing the chickens to continue walking as before. The youth stops at three grocers: an almond, an apricot, and a grapefruit tree. The youth asks for the three almond brands, and each brand appears as a separate meal at the three grocers. After catching up with his brother, the youth reaches into his bag and pulls out the apricot and tree, respectively. The brothers trade a bag of seeds for the three identical sisters, and the skin of each of them becomes a skin of beef. The brothers talk to each other about how to tell which is which, the youth goes for the beef, the beef brand becomes a branch of the tree, and the skin of each of the trees become bran. They trade a branch for a few tree limbs, and the youth goes for the beef brand.His brothers talk to each other about which fruit to chop, and the youth goes for the fruit. He chops the branches; the branch comes out a foot and a half long, and he then gives it to the youth. He pours the youth that fruit into the ground. He then goes back to his house for another grain.The brother trades a branch for a few branches, and the skin of each becomes flesh and bone. The brother goes for a goat skin, and the skin of each a branch comes out a foot long and half long, and he went to the house of the butcher. The brother went to the butcher himself, and gave him the goat skin and the skin of the skin met with curiosity. The butcher himself went back to his house, and gave him the goat skin and the skin of the goat. He did not know what he was\n",

            " they arrived at the princesss castle, the Prince ordered the children to work as servants for him, and threw them into a bears basket. The boy broke the basket, and a little bear appeared, which brought them to the princesss castle.The Prince was deeply distressed when his seven children, including the princess, broke the ball.  He had to carry it in his bags and retrieve it from the bear, who brought them to the princesss castle. The bear threw the Prince into a river, and he was thrown in prison; when the princess woke, the prince had gone to help the bear, and so on down to the hilt.The prince had to carry the princesss ball again, carrying it in his bags, but the princess noticed that he was carrying a pitcher instead. Saying she would not like it, he threw her into the river and took her home. He gave the princess a great gift, which said they would be well on their way, and they set out later (on Megaraptorski island) and said that Little Peter would like to introduce himself. The princess, however, did not like the name.  Finding the name difficult to come by, he sent her to a wellshot, where the well had a great flame casting black eyes and black hands. The princess instead went into the well itself, and the princess caught the princess around her neck.  After the princess complained, the well burst, and she fell into a deep pit.  The prince found her while she was casting spells, and the princess told him she was afraid of the Westerlies flames casting her eyes over, so he sent her to break off two handfuls. She caught up with him in the well, and he sent her to his sister, where he threw her in the well. She told him to make her a stairway to his world, and nothing would stop her. They set out on the mountain. At the top, they learned, they asked about the giants, and the prince told them to ask \"the giants\" (Danish: har vag, irga-tur, or  Skjæppe) if they would want them in captivity. They got them in a tiny boat; the prince made them flute themselves to the King of the Eagles so he could come home.The boat was stuck in the middle of it, and the prince got himself in the boat and stranded it outside. He said he would never return to the Kingdoms, and his older brothers had promised to take him away and give him gold and other treasures, without a word. One day, he asked for a new bridle, and his older brothers gave him one but said they would not give it to him unless he freed them from his service. He set out to find them. At the seashore, he saw a boatman and found a mans daughter. The man was trying to load the girl onto, but the woman was already married to a witch. The man took the daughter to claim her dowry, and then the next day he brought the girl to take the Kings daughter as his wife. The witch had the girl thrown out in the sand, but Little Peter saved her. He then said he would free the girls if he brought them food and water, and having done that, took the diamonds.Returning to his home, he found that his wife had miscarried. After some inquiries, he found out that the Princess had actually asked for the Kings aid, and being the fairest of them, begged him to take her as his wife. The youngest daughter sent a message to the King asking for him to give her his daughters. Although the King said he had no power to punish her, the witch-mother went after her dead husbands body. When she saw where the King was, she began to sing of her sufferings to his parents, and they set watch. A giant came despising them; his mother was suffocating with rage, so he carried her off. He brought the King to safety, but waited until his mother was undressed. Then he carried her to another giant, in which her enemies were asleep, but the King killed the others and sent her home. He showed her all the marvels in the world, and showed her how to weave them. She brought back all the treasures the King had stolen from the witch, and the King was not imprisoned as his mothers wish had him to be. He did not bear to see the Princess again, and in time, nearly died. Little Peter returned and had a long life.\n",

            "A boy called out to the emperor as far as his concerns. \"Do not go anywhere, he is too close\". He said he will not return until he cut his finger. The emperor stopped him and said that only a rusty knife could cut the finger. The boy said that he cut it and it worked. The emperor then took the knife and returned to his fathers castle.His father sent him out with an army, to take revenge. They went back and found a town on the opposite side of the sea. There, an old woman advised the boy to tie a thread to his hand to unlock it. He did and sent an embassy back to his fathers castle, and his people followed him back to the old womans house. There, while the old woman was making her bed, the kings son fell asleep and did not wake up. So the wicked emperor, in a moment of pride, tied the boy himself to the tree and made him stand there on a branch by the river.As soon as the boy was tied, he cried and the old woman told him that it was all over with. He threw him into jail, but on his way to see his fathers death, he asked his father for food and a pen and saw that his son was spared. When his father read the judgment, he cut the boy in two.He came to a house where a woman told him that tied him to the tree would put a curse on him and make him incapable of doing any good. He did it and got her some of her hair, and when she would be much removed from her duties as Mrs. Tree, and without removing the water from her fountain, turned her into a sparrow. She would not only remove the curse, but also have the sparrow winged around her. Then she would tie an apple to his hand; if he were clean-shaven, he could get the apple and could shed feathers, so doing so would remove the scari for him.He came to a country where a rich man had been dancing at a country tournament. The young man asked permission to dance at the tournament and the young man accepted. The countryman offered him lodging, but during the night he wore a coat with a deep red front and barefoot forays into the Black Forest into the Black Sea. In the morning, he pulled out a golden needle and was filled with gold.His rope appeared and would not turn if he was below sea level, the ground beneath it a deep purple sea, just like the sea itself. It would take him to a far land and away from home, a desert far more wonderful than the princes palace.He came to a lady whose husband was a wizard who had taken the form of a lion a number of years earlier. The lady had put her of inferior caste into the suit, but someone had merely wished to please her, and so had left. In exchange for her service, he told her where the Master Maid and the Queens hidden chamber were, and also gave her a bottle of water that conferred powers comparable to a monk having lost the powers of his ancestors through experience and reflection.She left before him.into the palace, and asking who else could tell him how to find the Master Maid and the Queens hidden chamber. A woman with the figure went in, promising to aid his quest. The Master Maid appeared, and offered her service.disguised herself as a priest, she opened the bottle of water and a prayer book containing the information he had been promised. He regained his senses, and instructed the monk on how to lead his path. As the Master Maid, he transformed her into fish and offered them to the king.  The king paid the priest as much as his expenses to have the Master Maid take the Slave into the castle.In the morning, the Master Maid turned the fish into a hundred foot long and three foot wide statues of jewels and other treasures, and left them resting places. The Master Maid displayed the statues to the king, but he demanded that the Master Maid perform some tasks for him. The Slave looked through his book every night or else he would be turned into a frog. When the Master Maid refused to take part in the tasks, the Master Maid smashed the statue to pieces. The Master Maid then proceeded to break open a grape. Again, the statue looked like a man. The Master Maid then revealed the location of a gold watch. As before, the watch was unchangeable,had his masters, and all other suitors disappear into thin air. The Master Maid then revealed that a copper watch was changeable in exchange for a golden coin. The Master Maid would only trade the slave for the watch.The Master Maid then demanded that pieces of jewelry drop from the Master Maid as they danced. Every time the Master Maid would dance, the Master Maid would hear the Master Maids voice, which would cause the Master Maid to lose his sight. Forced to dance death\n",

            "The story is about a father and his two little girls, Parvati and Aase. Their mother is a witch, who has an evil magic daughter named Gotthar. One day, Parvati goes to the forest to cut branches and sees a frog. The girl picks the branch and goes to a hidden room. There, a being from the church tells her that if she tries to go to the church she will get burned and unless she do nothing then she will never get married. Parvati goes to the church and attempts to get the flax item that grants the wish. When she returns, the frog gets into the girls flesh and does not provide any comfort.Parvati goes to the wedding, but a horrid stop. Parvati is refused food, given a mango that does not taste the mango, and is repeatedly turned to stone by the god-like Parvati. Parvati makes her husband flee with the flaxed frog. The frog returns every time soon after and uses this excuse to abduct the girl. Parvati is eventually forced to do much more evil than just that. She takes on more and more dangerous duties, fights with the God-like Rupasimar and finally escapes from her husbands house. Parvati is eventually led by the appearance of the god-like Rupasimar who commands that her stepmother, the water-sailing serpent, must spin cloth and complete the craft. The god-like takes her to his home and has her sit in the water churning while she spinsrafts using an iron spindle. The girl is left to the churns with no direction and no way to get to her aid. The girl is eventually taken by the god-like and she follows him to the house of the wicked magician Dulavitra.

She takes the spindle and the golden flax, and goes to the forest to gather the flax. The trees, men, and things come to her and threaten to devour her unless she answer them all: that is, she must spin cloth and get rid of the last bird, and that will take three days. The man helping her asks her if she has anything to add.She answers yes, and he follows her. He visits a merchants house, gets a horse, a dog, and a mans beard, then takes a boat to the far country of India and returns to the fishermans home.

            "Sherlock Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson early one winter morning to rush to a murder scene at the Abbey Grange near Chislehurst, Kent. Sir Eustace Brackenstall has been killed, apparently by burglars. Inspector Stanley Hopkins believes that it was the infamous Randall gang who have committed several other burglaries in the neighborhood.At Abbey Grange, Lady Brackenstall tells Holmes that her marriage was not happy; Sir Eustace was a violent, abusive drunkard. She then tells that about 11 oclock, in the dining room, she encountered an elderly man coming in the French window, followed by two younger men. The older man struck her in the face, knocking her out. When she came to, she was gagged and tied to an oaken chair with the bellrope, which they had torn down. Sir Eustace came into the room and rushed at the intruders, one of whom struck and killed him with a poker. Lady Brackenstall fainted again for a minute or two. She saw the intruders drinking wine from a bottle taken from the sideboard. Then they left, taking some silver plate.Sir Eustaces corpse is still lying at the murder scene. Hopkins tells Holmes some unsavoury things about Sir Eustace: that he poured petroleum over his wifes dog and set it alight, and once threw a decanter at her maid Theresa. Theresa corroborates Lady Brackenstalls account of Sir Eustace being an abusive alcoholic.Examining the bellrope, Holmes notes that if it was tugged hard enough to tear it down, the bell would have rung in the kitchen, and asks why nobody heard it. Hopkins answers that it was late, and the kitchen is at the back of the house, where none of the servants would have heard. This suggests that the burglars must have known this, indicating a link between them and one of the servants. Oddly, the thieves stole only a few items of silver plate from the dining room. The half-empty wine bottle and glasses interest Holmes - the cork had been drawn with the corkscrew of a \"multiplex knife\", not the long corkscrew in the drawer, and one of the glasses has beeswing dregs in it, but the others have none.Annoyed at being called to investigate a case that apparently has a ready-made solution, Holmes decides to catch the train back to London. However, after having mulled things over during the journey, Holmes thinks that Lady Brackenstalls story has too many holes in it and that probably she and Theresa have lied deliberately, staging a false crime scene. Upon returning to the Abbey Grange, Holmes, after examining again the supposed crime scene, reaches this conclusion: the killer cut the bellrope with a knife, and frayed the loose end to make it look broken. Holmes confronts Lady Brackenstall and Theresa, telling them he knows they are lying and demanding the truth, but they stand by their story. On the way out, Holmes notices a hole in the ice on the pond, and writes a note for Hopkins.Holmes searches for the killer: almost certainly a sailor (indicated by the knots and the active physique) who was previously acquainted with Lady Brackenstall, and whom she and Theresa would protect. Lady Brackenstall traveled by the ocean liner Rock of Gibraltar of the Adelaide-Southampton Line, which is now halfway to Australia. However, the ships first officer, Jack Crocker, who has been promoted to captain, has remained in England and in two days will take command of the companys new ship, Bass Rock. Holmes takes a cab to Scotland Yard but does not go in. He tells Watson he is reluctant to name the criminal to the police until he knows more.That evening, Hopkins calls at 221B Baker Street, with two items of news:As suggested in Holmes note, the stolen silver was found at the bottom of the pond. Holmes suggests that the theft was a blind—a deliberate false clue. However, Hopkins rationalises that the pond was chosen as a temporary hiding place.The Randall gang was arrested in New York that morning, so they couldnt have committed a murder in Kent the previous night.Later that evening, Captain Crocker comes to Baker Street, summoned by a telegram from Holmes. Holmes demands a full account of what happened at the Abbey Grange, warning Crocker that Holmes will summon the police if he lies or conceals anything.Crocker met a woman named Mary (Lady Brackenstall) on the voyage from Australia. He fell in love with her, but not she with him. Then he happened to meet Theresa, who told him of Sir Eustaces abusive behaviour. He met secretly with Mary at the house; the last time on the previous night. They were in the dining room when Sir Eustace burst in, insulted Mary, and struck her with a cudgel. He then attacked Crocker, who killed him with the poker in self-defence. Crocker adds that he has no regret whatever. To avoid the scandal that could ensue, Crocker and Theresa concocted the cover story of burglars caught in the act. He cut down the bellrope exactly as Holmes deduced; he opened the wine bottle with his pocket knifes corkscrew; he took some silver plate and dropped it in the pond.Holmes tells Crocker that the police dont yet know the truth, and that he will wait 24 hours before revealing it, allowing Crocker to get away. Crocker indignantly refuses the offer, insisting that he will only agree to any version of the case that will leave Mary out of it. But Holmes was only testing Crocker, and is impressed by his loyalty to Mary. He has given Hopkins \"an excellent hint\" and doesnt feel he must do more. He designates Watson as the \"jury\", and asks him to \"render a verdict.\" Watson declares Crocker \"not guilty.\" Holmes tells Crocker he will keep silent unless someone else is charged, and that he may come back to Mary in a year.\n",

The half-empty wine bottle and glasses interest Holmes - the cork had been drawn with the corkscrew of a \"multiplex knife\", not the long corkscrew in the drawer, and one of the glasses has beeswing dregs in it, but the others have none.Annoyed at being called to investigate a case that apparently has a ready-made solution, Holmes decides to catch the train back to London. However, after having mulled things over during the journey, Holmes thinks that Lady Brackenstalls story has too many holes in it and that probably she and Theresa have lied deliberately, staging a false crime scene. Upon returning to the Abbey Grange, Holmes, after examining again the supposed crime scene, reaches this conclusion: the killer cut the bellrope with a knife, and frayed the loose end to make it look broken. Holmes confronts Lady Brackenstall and Theresa, telling them he knows they are lying and demanding the truth, but they stand by their story. On the way out, Holmes notices a hole in the ice on the pond, and writes a note for Hopkins.Holmes searches for the killer: almost certainly a sailor (indicated by the knots and the active physique) who was previously acquainted with Lady Brackenstall, and whom she and Theresa would protect. Lady Brackenstall traveled by the ocean liner Rock of Gibraltar of the Adelaide-Southampton Line, which is now halfway to Australia. However, the ships first officer, Jack Crocker, who has been promoted to captain, has remained in England and in two days will take command of the companys new ship, Bass Rock. Holmes takes a cab to Scotland Yard but does not go in. He tells Watson he is reluctant to name the criminal to the police until he knows more.That evening, Hopkins calls at 221B Baker Street, with two items of news:As suggested in Holmes note, the stolen silver was found at the bottom of the pond. Holmes suggests that the theft was a blind—a deliberate false clue. However, Hopkins rationalises that the pond was chosen as a temporary hiding place.The Randall gang was arrested in New York that morning, so they couldnt have committed a murder in Kent the previous night.Later that evening, Captain Crocker comes to Baker Street, summoned by a telegram from Holmes. Holmes demands a full account of what happened at the Abbey Grange, warning Crocker that Holmes will summon the police if he lies or conceals anything.Crocker met a woman named Mary (Lady Brackenstall) on the voyage from Australia. He fell in love with her, but not she with him. Then he happened to meet Theresa, who told him of Sir Eustaces abusive behaviour. He met secretly with Mary at the house; the last time on the previous night. They were in the dining room when Sir Eustace burst in, insulted Mary, and struck her with a cudgel. He then attacked Crocker, who killed him with the poker in self-defence. Crocker adds that he has no regret whatever. To avoid the scandal that could ensue, Crocker and Theresa concocted the cover story of burglars caught in the act. He cut down the bellrope exactly as Holmes deduced; he opened the wine bottle with his pocket knifes corkscrew; he took some silver plate and dropped it in the pond.Holmes tells Crocker that the police dont yet know the truth, and that he will wait 24 hours before revealing it, allowing Crocker to get away. Crocker indignantly refuses the offer, insisting that he will only agree to any version of the case that will leave Mary out of it. But Holmes was only testing Crocker, and is impressed by his loyalty to Mary. He has given Hopkins \"an excellent hint\" and doesnt feel he must do more. He designates Watson as the \"jury\", and asks him to \"render a verdict.\" Watson declares Crocker \"not guilty.\" Holmes tells Crocker he will keep silent unless someone else is charged, and that he may come back to Mary in a year.\n",

            "Sherlock Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson early one winter morning to rush to a murder scene at the Abbey Grange near Chislehurst, Kent. Sir Eustace Brackenstall has been killed, apparently by burglars. Inspector Stanley Hopkins believes that it was the infamous Randall gang who have committed several other burglaries in the neighborhood.At Abbey Grange, Lady Brackenstall tells Holmes that her marriage was not happy; Sir Eustace was a violent, abusive drunkard. She then tells that about 11 oclock, in the dining room, she encountered an elderly man coming in the French window, followed by two younger men. The older man struck her in the face, knocking her out. When she came to, she was gagged and tied to an oaken chair with the bellrope, which they had torn down. Sir Eustace came into the room and rushed at the intruders, one of whom struck and killed him with a poker. Lady Brackenstall fainted again for a minute or two. She saw the intruders drinking wine from a bottle taken from the sideboard. Then they left, taking some silver plate.Sir Eustaces corpse is still lying at the murder scene. Hopkins tells Holmes some unsavoury things about Sir Eustace: that he poured petroleum over his wifes dog and set it alight, and once threw a decanter at her maid Theresa. Theresa corroborates Lady Brackenstalls account of Sir Eustace being an abusive alcoholic.Examining the bellrope, Holmes notes that if it was tugged hard enough to tear it down, the bell would have rung in the kitchen, and asks why nobody heard it. Hopkins answers that it was late, and the kitchen is at the back of the house, where none of the servants would have heard.

            "Sherlock Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson early one winter morning to rush to a murder scene at the Abbey Grange near Chislehurst, Kent. Sir Eustace Brackenstall has been killed, apparently by burglars. Inspector Stanley Hopkins believes that it was the infamous Randall gang who have committed several other burglaries in the neighborhood.At Abbey Grange, Lady Brackenstall tells Holmes that her marriage was not happy; Sir Eustace was a violent, abusive drunkard. She then tells that about 11 oclock, in the dining room, she encountered an elderly man coming in the French window, followed by two younger men. The older man struck her in the face, knocking her out. When she came to, she was gagged and tied to an oaken chair with the bellrope, which they had torn down. Sir Eustace came into the room and rushed at the intruders, one of whom struck and killed him with a poker. Lady Brackenstall fainted again for a minute or two. She saw the intruders drinking wine from a bottle taken from the sideboard. Then they left, taking some silver plate.Sir Eustaces corpse is still lying at the murder scene. Hopkins tells Holmes some unsavoury things about Sir Eustace: that he poured petroleum over his wifes dog and set it alight, and once threw a decanter at her maid Theresa. Theresa corroborates Lady Brackenstalls account of Sir Eustace being an abusive alcoholic.Examining the bellrope, Holmes notes that if it was tugged hard enough to tear it down, the bell would have rung in the kitchen, and asks why nobody heard it. Hopkins answers that it was late, and the kitchen is at the back of the house, where none of the servants would have heard. This suggests that the burglars must have known this, indicating a link between them and one of the servants. Oddly, the thieves stole only a few items of silver plate from the dining room. The half-empty wine bottle and glasses interest Holmes - the cork had been drawn with the corkscrew of a \"multiplex knife\", not the long corkscrew in the drawer, and one of the glasses has beeswing dregs in it, but the others have none.Annoyed at being called to investigate a case that apparently has a ready-made solution, Holmes decides to catch the train back to London. However, after having mulled things over during the journey, Holmes thinks that Lady Brackenstalls story has too many holes in it and that probably she and Theresa have lied deliberately, staging a false crime scene. Upon returning to the Abbey Grange, Holmes, after examining again the supposed crime scene, reaches this conclusion: the killer cut the bellrope with a knife, and frayed the loose end to make it look broken. Holmes confronts Lady Brackenstall and Theresa, telling them he knows they are lying and demanding the truth, but they stand by their story. On the way out, Holmes notices a hole in the ice on the pond, and writes a note for Hopkins.Holmes searches for the killer: almost certainly a sailor (indicated by the knots and the active physique) who was previously acquainted with Lady Brackenstall, and whom she and Theresa would protect. Lady Brackenstall traveled by the ocean liner Rock of Gibraltar of the Adelaide-Southampton Line, which is now halfway to Australia. However, the ships first officer, Jack Crocker, who has been promoted to captain, has remained in England and in two days will take command of the companys new ship, Bass Rock. Holmes takes a cab to Scotland Yard but does not go in. He tells Watson he is reluctant to name the criminal to the police until he knows more.That evening, Hopkins calls at 221B Baker Street, with two items of news:As suggested in Holmes note, the stolen silver was found at the bottom of the pond. Holmes suggests that the theft was a blind—a deliberate false clue. However, Hopkins rationalises that the pond was chosen as a temporary hiding place.The Randall gang was arrested in New York that morning, so they couldnt have committed a murder in Kent the previous night.Later that evening, Captain Crocker comes to Baker Street, summoned by a telegram from Holmes. Holmes demands a full account of what happened at the Abbey Grange, warning Crocker that Holmes will summon the police if he lies or conceals anything.Crocker met a woman named Mary (Lady Brackenstall) on the voyage from Australia. He fell in love with her, but not she with him. Then he happened to meet Theresa, who told him of Sir Eustaces abusive behaviour. He met secretly with Mary at the house; the last time on the previous night. They were in the dining room when Sir Eustace burst in, insulted Mary, and struck her with a cudgel. He then attacked Crocker, who killed him with the poker in self-defence. Crocker adds that he has no regret whatever. To avoid the scandal that could ensue, Crocker and Theresa concocted the cover story of burglars caught in the act. He cut down the bellrope exactly as Holmes deduced; he opened the wine bottle with his pocket knifes corkscrew; he took some silver plate and dropped it in the pond.Holmes tells Crocker that the police dont yet know the truth, and that he will wait 24 hours before revealing it, allowing Crocker to get away. Crocker indignantly refuses the offer, insisting that he will only agree to any version of the case that will leave Mary out of it. But Holmes was only testing Crocker, and is impressed by his loyalty to Mary. He has given Hopkins \"an excellent hint\" and doesnt feel he must do more. He designates Watson as the \"jury\", and asks him to \"render a verdict.\" Watson declares Crocker \"not guilty.\" Holmes tells Crocker he will keep silent unless someone else is charged, and that he may come back to Mary in a year.\n",

            "Sherlock Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson early one winter morning to rush to a murder scene at the Abbey Grange near Chislehurst, Kent. Sir Eustace Brackenstall has been killed, apparently by burglars. Inspector Stanley Hopkins believes that it was the infamous Randall gang who have committed several other burglaries in the neighborhood.At Abbey Grange, Lady Brackenstall tells Holmes that her marriage was not happy; Sir Eustace was a violent, abusive drunkard. She then tells that about 11 oclock, in the dining room, she encountered an elderly man coming in the French window, followed by two younger men. The older man struck her in the face, knocking her out. When she came to, she was gagged and tied to an oaken chair with the bellrope, which they had torn down. Sir Eustace came into the room and rushed at the intruders, one of whom struck and killed him with a poker. Lady Brackenstall fainted again for a minute or two. She saw the intruders drinking wine from a bottle taken from the sideboard. Then they left, taking some silver plate.Sir Eustaces corpse is still lying at the murder scene. Hopkins tells Holmes some unsavoury things about Sir Eustace: that he poured petroleum over his wifes dog and set it alight, and once threw a decanter at her maid Theresa. Theresa corroborates Lady Brackenstalls account of Sir Eustace being an abusive alcoholic.Examining the bellrope, Holmes notes that if it was tugged hard enough to tear it down, the bell would have rung in the kitchen, and asks why nobody heard it. Hopkins answers that it was late, and the kitchen is at the back of the house, where none of the servants would have heard. This suggests that the burglars must have known this, indicating a link between them and one of the servants. Oddly, the thieves stole only a few items of silver plate from the dining room. The half-empty wine bottle and glasses interest Holmes - the cork had been drawn with the corkscrew of a \"multiplex knife\", not the long corkscrew in the drawer, and one of the glasses has beeswing dregs in it, but the others have none.Annoyed at being called to investigate a case that apparently has a ready-made solution, Holmes decides to catch the train back to London. However, after having mulled things over during the journey, Holmes thinks that Lady Brackenstalls story has too many holes in it and that probably she and Theresa have lied deliberately, staging a false crime scene. Upon returning to the Abbey Grange, Holmes, after examining again the supposed crime scene, reaches this conclusion: the killer cut the bellrope with a knife, and frayed the loose end to make it look broken. Holmes confronts Lady Brackenstall and Theresa, telling them he knows they are lying and demanding the truth, but they stand by their story. On the way out, Holmes notices a hole in the ice on the pond, and writes a note for Hopkins.Holmes searches for the killer: almost certainly a sailor (indicated by the knots and the active physique) who was previously acquainted with Lady Brackenstall, and whom she and Theresa would protect. Lady Brackenstall traveled by the ocean liner Rock of Gibraltar of the Adelaide-Southampton Line, which is now halfway to Australia. However, the ships first officer, Jack Crocker, who has been promoted to captain, has remained in England and in two days will take command of the companys new ship, Bass Rock. Holmes takes a cab to Scotland Yard but does not go in. He tells Watson he is reluctant to name the criminal to the police until he knows more.That evening, Hopkins calls at 221B Baker Street, with two items of news:As suggested in Holmes note, the stolen silver was found at the bottom of the pond. Holmes suggests that the theft was a blind—a deliberate false clue. However, Hopkins rationalises that the pond was chosen as a temporary hiding place.The Randall gang was arrested in New York that morning, so they couldnt have committed a murder in Kent the previous night.Later that evening, Captain Crocker comes to Baker Street, summoned by a telegram from Holmes. Holmes demands a full account of what happened at the Abbey Grange, warning Crocker that Holmes will summon the police if he lies or conceals anything.Crocker met a woman named Mary (Lady Brackenstall) on the voyage from Australia. He fell in love with her, but not she with him. Then he happened to meet Theresa, who told him of Sir Eustaces abusive behaviour. He met secretly with Mary at the house; the last time on the previous night. They were in the dining room when Sir Eustace burst in, insulted Mary, and struck her with a cudgel.
